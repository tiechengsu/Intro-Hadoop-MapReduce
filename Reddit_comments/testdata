AskReddit	haggardclint	"When I was a youngster until I was I was in my teens, I had the same recurring figure. Not the same dream, always ended differently with different events but always started with the same figure. Let me paint the picture here first. My bedroom window looked out on to a culdersac at the top of a very steep hill. It was lit by one street lamp. If you looked out into it at night, culdersac would be lit but it's entry would plunge off into oblivion. So from my window every night, I could see what looked like (to me) the poster from The Exorcist.  Now, the dream would always start the same. I'd be sleeping, and wake up to the faint incoming tune from beyond the hill. I would hear this tune grow as the figure of my nightmares would make it's way, lumbering up the hill. The tune was some sort of low double bass Looney Tunes or Tom &amp; Jerry number I can never find the name of. The figure? Sweetums from The Muppets. He would dance/lumber up into the light of the culdersac and I would immediately try to hide under the covers or bed or in the closet, nothing ever worked. I'd always hear him coming into the house and then down the hallway, into my room where he would proceed to violently fling me against shit until I was broken and laid their bleeding before finally putting me out of my misery and crushing my head. Often either with his foot, something nearby or by just biting down.  Over the years the dream varied as I learned to run and hide and escape into different areas of the house but everything always ended the same. One of the most messed up scenarios once was when he had two dogs, big white wolves actually. He sicked them on me and that went just swimmingly. Another time he possessed my family and turned them all into red eyed catatonics who if I approached them they'd open their mouths wide as a snakes and reveal their teeth and tongue (looked like the mouth of a freaking deep sea angler fish), horrifying.  The last time I dreamed about Sweetums though was the most interesting...  The dream started the same way it always did. The impending music, Sweetums lumbering into the light of the culdersac, but this time I didn't hide. I didn't even leave my room. In fact I just sat there, waiting, watching the door for Sweetums. And as the music got to it's usual loud state with his proximity he stopped in the door way and just stared at me. Me at him and him back at me. For the first time ever he spoke, in my Dad's voice... ""Well done. I'm proud of you."" Then he walked away.  I've never seen him since... 7 years of recurring nightmares at it ends with that."	1430438409	1	0	0	0

It's very important to teach students foundational academic skills which will serve them in college and for the rest of their lives: math, english, etc. Teachers are responsible for not only teaching this stuff, but also for making the case that it is important, and that students will need it in their lives, so that they will use it and learn to improve their faculties independently. In other words, they learn how to learn. In order to be comprehensible, advanced subjects, i.e. life skills, require the above foundational knowledge.  	1430438410	1	0	0	0

So much so that they literally glow.   Most of them are very un-Britishly friendly.  Many are eager to explain that, compared to their homeland, liquor is very cheap here.

AskReddit	LordAnope	"I have very vivid dreams every night, here are the two most common.  - I walk down the stairs into a dark basement. There is always a door at the bottom. It slowly creeks open and a giant hissing crocodile emerges. I try to scramble up the stairs and keep tripping and falling the whole way up. I finally get to the top and collapse and my legs wont work. I try to scream for help but nothing comes out, all while this croc slowly gets closer and closer. Eventually it gets to me and eats me.  - This one the context of the dream is always different except for 1 detail it always takes place in the mountains. I could be riding a bike, in the city in the middle of a car chase, or in a park with some girl I wanna bang. Then out of nowhere a giant meteorite impacts the side of a mountain nearby and huge chunk of the mountain gets blown off and flies towards me. It is always so vivid and real. So this chunk is massive and I know there is nothing I can do but just watch it fly towards me. Right before it impacts I wake up.  I forgot about a sleep paralysis dream I get. Not as common as the other 2, I get it maybe 3 times a year. I will be lying in bed and then I wake up (at least I think I do) but I cant move a single muscle. The only thing that functions is my eyes. Then a black cat with glowing eyes will jump up onto the foot of the bed start hissing at and screeching at me while it slowly crawls up my body towards my face. I will try and kick and scream but nothing works. Its much like the Crocodile dream except I can see and sense everything going on around me. my girlfriend has even been watching TV beside me while it happens and looked at me and asked ""whats wrong with me?"" while I stare into space not blinking or moving. And I can see her and hear her but cant respond. eventually the cat gets to my stomach, crouches low lets out a hiss and pounces at my throat. As its mid leap it just turns to smoke and disappears. The second it disappears I can move and scream, and I do every time.... The weird part is everything stays the same its like the only thing that was dream was the cat that was put into the real world that I see in front of me. "	1430438495	3	0	0	0

Everything is just a little bit skewed and distorted, like a salvador dali painting. As soon as I recognize the room again, paper-think presidents start creeping towards me from impossible places. I've got Abe Lincoln, arms stretched towards me, coming out of a drawer. Andy Jackson is emerging from behind a painting. They never do get to touch me but it's a terrifying couple of seconds until I wake up.	1430438510	1	0	0	0

AskReddit	dumbguy82	"Your observations are correct.  I do look for those subtle reinforcements because I don't want to see them.  I want to eliminate them off my list of things which are or are not possible.  I started having a thought about a year ago.   I came to the stunning realization that I'm the only thing in existence that can feel any way about me.   That didn't change that fact that outside influences had an effect on my feelings, but to really realize that was pretty important I think.  Even when others judge you, it's your feelings that make you feel what you feel.   Also, that feeling you described about feeling ""bad"", and ""Not worthy"", those are bang on.   Because I've realized that I feel very uncomfortable around innocence.   Around babies/children, dogs, really kind people, family....etc.  I am naturally attracted to dark things, those things interest me more than positive light things, and that's supposed to be bad and negative.    My idea of heaven is not white and bright things and perfectly clean clothing, it's carnivals and fun houses, and fast cars and tunnels that lead to alternate dimensions and entertainment (basically Earth minus the shit I don't like)....etc.   I've always wondered if that is spiritual, or psychological, or if they are one and the same.  I've heard it's kind of common to be afraid of children, but I think it's weird.   I guess i'm into some stuff that most would consider kind of shameful, and I know that if they knew they'd feel differently about me.  Only my closest friend knows about one of them, and I am very fortunate that he is alright knowing it.  The way I feel, is beyond my control though...But one can feel like a dud, when comparing themselves to the status quo or general ideas about what constitutes a good soul, or a corrupt damaged one.  it's natural I guess.

AskReddit	bearlife	As a future teacher (1 more year) I've heard that one of the best places to get discouraged form teaching is the teacher's lounge. Usually because teachers go there to get away from the kids and often times complain about them. Surrounding yourself with people who don't like kids will make you not like kids. So I think it's bad for a different reason in that these teachers will begin disliking teaching more and more and will hurt students views to learning before they quit. You have to love kids and teaching otherwise you're doing a disservice to the students.	1430438520	5	0	0	0

AskReddit	TatTater	I am sorry to be the baron of bad news, but you seem buttered, so allow me to play doubles advocate here for a moment. For all intensive purposes I think you are wrong. In an age where false morals are a diamond dozen, true virtues are a blessing in the skies, and are more than just ice king on the cake. We often put our false morality on a petal stool like a bunch of pre-Madonnas, but you all seem to be taking something very valuable for granite. So I ask of you to mustard up all the strength you can because it is a doggy dog world out there. Although there is some merit to what you are saying it seems like you have a huge ship on your shoulder. In your argument you seem to throw everything in but the kids Nsync, and even though you are having a feel day with this I am here to bring you back into reality. I have a sick sense when it comes to these types of things. It is almost spooky, because I cannot turn a blonde eye to these glaring flaws in your rhetoric. I have zero taller ants when it comes to people spouting out hate in the name of moral righteousness. You just need to remember what comes around is all around, and when supply and command fails you will be the first to go. Make my words, when you get down to brass stacks it doesn't take rocket appliances to get two birds stoned at once. It's clear who makes the pants in this relationship, and sometimes you just have to swallow your prize and accept the fax, instead of making a half-harded effort. You might have to come to this conclusion through denial and error but I swear on my mother's mating name that when you put the petal to the medal you will pass with flying carpets like it's a peach of cake.	1430438531	10	0	0	0

If you enter into a 30 year contract without taking the time to understand the risks involved, or hire someone who can explain it to you, then you are taking on a level of risk you should be willing to accept. You're saying it's not these peoples fault.  Well who else is at fault for getting a mortgage they can't afford? Who else decided to buy a house with no money down on an ARM? When you buy a house you can't afford, just like anything else, you run the risk of losing your home. Period. 	1430438548	1	0	0	0

I would think any rule against gay sex then would be just as applicable now.  Honestly, for most thinking people, there needs to be an actual reason for a change in the laws (especially those mandated by God), but I can't see why any rule against gay sex then would be less applicable now.  Seriously, why would god say that homosexuals should be executed?  Why was that okay back then, but not now?  As for ""Hate the sin. Love the sinner"", it's like saying ""I still love you, but I hate a thing that you do that is (likely) closely tied with a major part of your identity.""  There's no denying that many people have used the Bible to justify hatred against gays.  And look at 1 Timothy 1:10.  It literally compares homosexuals to murderers and slavers.  Even if hatred of gays wasn't the intent, these statements still encourage it."	1430438562	5	0	0	0

AskReddit	lilhurt38	I have a pretty noticeable scar just to the left of my sternum. I was a little drunk and I tried to hop a fence to get into the pool for my apartment complex. I forgot the key in my apartment. There was a piece of metal that jutted out from the fence and I scraped my chest on it. I put on some butterfly bandages and I figured that I'd just go into the ER the next day to get it stitched up. I went in and they told me that the wound had already healed too much for them to be able to give me stitches.

The kid just sat there with a blank look on his face all day, every day. We're going over the human body and digestion one day and teacher decides to throw Danny an easy question out to boost him up a bit. She asks him how we get liquid into our bodies.  Danny sits there with a blank look and says ""I don't know"". She prompts him again by asking how he gets liquid into his body when he's thirsty. Danny replies, ""I don't know."" She is amazingly frustrated by this point and goes as far to ask ""Danny, how do you get water into your body when you're thirsty?"" and he replies, ""I don't know. Through your skin, maybe?""  She freaks out and loses her shit. He's sitting there looking dazed as always and Mrs. Teacher charges to the back of the room and grabs his arm. She pulls him out of his seat and drags him to the front of the classroom where there was a sink.  The water gets turned on and she shoves his arm into the stream and keeps yelling at him ""Through the skin?? THROUGH THE SKIN!?  How are you feeling now? Are you getting full? Are you getting enough water? YOU DRINK WATER WITH YOUR MOUTH!""

AskReddit	designated_shitter	"&gt; Honestly, I have never heard any say it.  I believe you that you haven't heard it, although I have definitely heard it.  And among the general public this is said almost constantly.  If you're looking for me to go combing through 30+ years of various politicians' speeches and remarks, I'll just be honest: I'm not doing that for the sake of a random internet discussion.  If you think it's worth digging, be my guest. [**EDIT**: although see my comment [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/34ffo5/what_one_sentence_can_someone_say_to_make_you/cqulldd) for a couple of examples that I found without trouble.]  The point is that is that it's not as if people haven't heard this message.  That message is there.  MY point is that addressing these things you list, just by themselves, are not *enough*.  And it's far more complicated than ""don't have kids.""  Birth control is a pretty significant factor, and on that score it's not even as simple as ""don't have sex.""   Maybe you've gotten the impression that liberals are a-okay with all those problems.  They're not, at all.  The difference is that (some) liberals recognize them as symptoms of broader issues.  And many of those broader issues are the result of long term policies which were put in place or are maintained out of racism.  That's the ""legacy"" people are always going on about.  So what's wrong with addressing those problems, too?  My concern here is that you seem to be saying those other things don't exist.   Now, our disagreement *should be* over how to address these systemic issues.  As a conservative, I'm sure you're against government programs that attempt to tackle poverty (and depending on the program, I might be too).  But I should think that you'd support means of ensuring more sensible sentencing, of reforming police departments whose behavior lead to eruptions like Baltimore and Ferguson and so on, etc.  "	1430438617	2	0	0	0

It seems like a useless word if you are correct, so I think I'll need a source to believe your claim.  That is to say, there is a large difference between your examples: you are comparing three words, person/people/peoples (edit: arguably four, counting persons, which is usually now replaced by people), to two words, fish/fishes."	1430438672	1	0	0	0

AskReddit	zeugma_kerfuffle	Tbh, as a linguist I'm not buying this etymology. Bae comes from African American English, which frequently has consonant deletion in word-final positions - usually with /g/ and /t/ [goin for going, don' for don't, can' for can't, etc] - but I could see it happening with babe -&gt; bae. Just a deletion of the /b/ consonant sound.  I think the 'before anyone else' / 'before all else' acronym explanation was just made up by white people so they don't feel like they're using 'ghetto' black slang.

AskReddit	Shenko-wolf	"My girlfriend and I were doing the long distance thing, she called me and told me we were breaking up because I was taking her for granted, and not putting any effort into the future of the relationship. That night, I thought about everything she'd said, and decided she was right, and that I needed to show I didn't take her for granted. Next morning, dropped $5k on a diamond, drove 800 kms in 7.5 hours to show up, kneeling, on her doorstep in the rain on a cold winter's night...  She said no.  ...............  Here's a cool dumb story. I was doing a Viking combat display for the National Maritime Museum in Sydney. Threw my shield at my opponent, who responded by reaching out and hitting my now exposed, unarmoured hand, and severed my left index finger. I was then taken into a nearby corporate lobby where I bled copiously over expensive Italian leather couches, then on to RPA hospital where I was the first sword related injury in over 100 years. Only part of the incident I remember is looking at where my finger was now hanging by a single tendon, seeing the bone and spurting blood, and saying,  ""That'll need stitches"".  My next clear memory is of sitting in the A+E waiting room oh the RPA with a bunch of other fully armed and armoured Vikings. Finger was surgically reattached and I retain about 90% functionality, but have a cool scar and a unique story."	1430438713	1	0	0	0

AskReddit	lostatsea93	He once confiscated my cell phone in class, (Back when flip phones were cool and showing off a cell phone was like, some kind of status symbol) and it remained on vibrate locked in his closet for the remainder of class. At this point, everyone in the class had basically had it with him and his bullshit in general, so everyone else who was cool enough to have cell phones at the time took turns calling my phone and the damn thing **did not stop vibrating** for the entire hour class. The look on his face was priceless. 	1430438805	1	0	0	0
AskReddit	farmingdale	&gt;Why don't they do this in america? So do you regularly see people on their phone calculator trying to work out the real price?  We dont have a vat. Sales taxes are set by multiple levels of government and it can change rapidly, not only that items can be tax free or taxed depending on where they are sold. As a result if some company tried that it wouldnt be able to run the same adverts everywhere and it would go insane printing out 100s of different prices for the same item.  Honestly, its not hard to add about 7% to something.	1430438805	1	0	0	0

AskReddit	dhamilt9	"I agree with you that calling ""trigger"" in an argument in an attempt to censor someone is bad. I just see the whole ""OMG you're triggering me"" satire posts so so so often, while I see the attempt to censor pretty much no where. I agree that there are a lot of children on tumblr that complain about a lot of stupid things. But a bunch of children and ""a few news articles"" about college kids who think they have everything all figured out (like a lot of people in college think) hardly warrant how much reddit likes to make fun of them.   Regarding your point about PTSD and psychology, I also agree that never confronting your traumatic situation is probably bad. However, I don't believe that many psychologists would agree that trigger warnings are a bad thing. Again, just because someone is choosing not to think about a traumatic experience in a given moment, it doesn't mean they're trying to block it out forever."	1430438828	1	0	0	0

The aliens would split up and go to all the windows, so I'd have to hide, but there wouldn't be any perfect hiding place and after a while they'd come into the house, so I'd have to keep moving from house to house and keep trying to get away. The giants would look in through the second-story windows and sometimes they'd tear the roofs off of the houses. I have blockout curtains on all of my windows these days.	1430438848	2	0	0	0

AskReddit	RaPlD	There are certain traits that are generally accepted as characteristic for the less intelligent. Like troubles with memory  and retention of non trivial facts, issues solving logical problems and math in general, sense of orientation, or just plainly doing things that are stupid on a daily basis. Like always looking for your keys when they are in your pocket, or not being able to memorize the layout of the town you live in or the building you work in, stuff like that. There are plenty of things that can make you feel stupid, and if they constantly come up, chances are you are not the brightest.     Lower intellect is not something that can't be acknowledged by the people that have it. What you are thinking of is a combination of ignorance and ego. 	1430438851	1	0	0	0

AskReddit	Greenhound	No, I don't mind people who choose to act and adopt the personality of the opposite gender, except think they're a little weird.  But if you've literally convinced yourself and lied to others that you are the opposite gender, you're mentally ill. Please don't recognize yourself as a female, but a M2F transgender or vice versa.  Queue the downvotes. I know a lot of people get pissed off at people like me for thinking like this, but please be honest with yourself, if you're a man, you're a man. If you're a woman, you're a woman. You're free to behave differently, but don't lie to yourself or other people.  EDIT: for illustration, imagine i went into a female bathroom and was held up by girls asking what i was doing there. i exclaim 'no no, it's cool! i'm a girl!' should i be denied access to the bathroom because i haven't made any effort to look like a girl? why does it matter what i look like? if i 'believe' i'm a girl i should be able to pee from my penis in here!	1430438869	-8	0	0	0

(Granted I play EU4 so I have above average knowledge of European Geography). Ljubljana is not a famous city. I had literally never heard of it until this thread. Outside of Russia, most people don't know shit about the Eastern bloc, primarily because those nations aren't large global players and never have been (Excluding Soviet involvement which was primarily Russia).   And we don't expect you to know our states. I know Europeans hate hearing this but since most of your countries are smaller than our states, we generally don't view them as very important (Especially since many states have larger populations and economies than many European Nations). So the same way Europeans know about their neighbors, the USA knows about its neighbors. Except for the USA those neighbors are other states and in Europe they are other nations.	1430438884	5	0	0	0

Nor should they have to put up with seeing some slob smacking his lips or dealing with the smells.  We in NYC started having this huge problem of people bringing in full cartons of fast food, etc. onto the train. Everyone was doing it--from the Yuppie Wall Streeters chowing down on an Egg McMuffin in the middle of morning rush hour to the hoodrats cracking open a full carton of Chinese food.

AskReddit	redplanetlover	"I have an odd story. When my wife's elderly aunt passed away we buried her and life went on but one day about 6 months later my 3 year old granddaughter was playing in her bedroom and my wife went in and was talking to her. Somehow Aunty Alma's name came up and my granddaughter said as casual as can be ""oh, she's right there in the chair"" (a chair in the corner). This sort of thing happened a few more times over the next year or so. She was the only person who could see her but she was there nevertheless. This story still creeps us all out."	1430438922	13	0	0	0

AskReddit	chevron_seven_locked	"&gt; to the more internal talking over them and not letting them get a word in edgewise.  Exhibit A, right here. You are doing this right now.  Piece of advice for the future: when trying to understand a group of people or viewpoint that is different from your own experience, don't argue or dismiss what the group is saying. Instead, recognize your own experience as being different and LISTEN.  Seriously, this right here is why I engage so few men in these conversations, because I know it's just going to turn into a cross-examination of the female experience, or men looking for a pat on the back for not partaking in the behavior I so often see. I get that this often happens because men simply *don't see* a lot of what women experience, or *don't see* it through a female lens. When they don't understand a described situation, because they have never been in a position where said situation would be threatening, a lot men will argue or dismiss the situation as not being a real concern.  It's great that you don't think women belong in the kitchen! I wish more people didn't. But protesting ""I'm a man and I don't do that!"" isn't helping the discussion. It honestly comes across as argumentative or derailing. /u/oliviathecf is explaining her experience. Your saying, ""I don't do that!"" doesn't contradict her experience, or the experiences of many, many women.   You are but one drop in the ocean, just like the rest of us. You sound like a good raindrop, one of many who respect women, but how many raindrops *don't?* Collectively, how big are their waves?  If you have genuine questions, ask them!   If a women shares an experience that you haven't had, don't debate! Ask to learn more about it and try to understand her point of view.  And above all, LISTEN."	1430438930	5	0	0	0

AskReddit	forkinanoutlet	"I had a teacher tell me I would ""fail at life,"" that I was ""a detestable little shit"" and some other legitimately upsetting shit because I didn't enjoy the book we were reading (well, to be fair, I was kind of a little shit as well, but it was uncalled for). I left class and went to the park to read in the sun, and came back for my next class.  The vice-principal was this wannabe hardass who had buzzed his hair and bleached it, which gave him the weird appearance of Eminem wearing a suit. He sneaks up behind me as I'm walking down the hall and bellows ""Going somewhere?"" before dragging me down to his office.  He sits me down in his chair and starts this whole intimidation routine, telling me that I have potentially ruined my entire high school career (I'm in grade 9 at this point, by the way), that I'm probably going to be expelled and have to go to a reformatory school, and then he starts interrogating me on my drug use and family situation; basically just going bizarrely over the line considering all I did was skip class.  I told him what she said and he didn't back off; started saying shit like ""I'm sure you misinterpreted that, there's no way she said that, did anybody hear her say that?"" When I told him that the entire class of around 30 kids had heard it, his face turned white and he just told me to go to my next class.  That teacher didn't look me in the eye for the rest of the year, never asked me a single question and didn't do anything regarding my piss-poor attendance. I passed the class with a 65 or 70, though I definitely should have failed.  In all honesty, from that point on, I was more interested in manipulating the teachers that treated me like shit instead of actually putting effort into their classes. I scraped by several of my classes with a 51% using blackmail after they snapped and said something shitty about me.  I dropped out of standard high school in grade 12 and went to an alternative school to finish up. When I got my university acceptance letters, I definitely went back to my old high school - both to thank the teachers who believed in me and helped me, and to show the teachers who acted like dicks to me how wrong they were about me. It might seem petty, but it felt pretty good telling that bitch who told me I would fail at life that I absolutely wouldn't. I also called her a sallow, reptilian bitch before leaving.  Okay, maybe I was a detestable little shit, but she could have been nicer about it."	1430438938	0	0	0	0

AskReddit	LXA_ZO_817	In Germany, there are three types of school that someone can go to once they hit a certain age (like 5th grade): Gymnasium, Realschule, Hauptschule.    Gymnasium normally leads to college because they are taking college prep like coujrses and finish by taking arbitur which is like their version of ACT/SAT.     Realschule is the next step down and these students typically find a job right after school like an apprenticeship. It is not normal for someone to go to college out of Realschule.    Hauptschule is the lowest level and a lot of immigrants are at this level. If you go to hauptschule, you are pretty much going to be doing an apprenticeship out of school or work low paying jobs. People out of hauptschule are generally never going to college.    When the time comes to decide who goes where, the student's teacher decides which school a child is capable of going. This decision is discussed with the parents during a meeting.   	1430438990	103	0	0	0

Had to get the principal to undo the whole thing and i believe they just threw a 10% penalty on me for being a jackass.  Not worth it btw. Way harder to accurately get into each bin since the class only had 11 items there was no margin for error.	1430439006	2	0	0	0

If you have never been educated to read and write in your first language a student tends to  need extra help. They also advise families to speak in their native languages in the home.

I imagine that this would be like us having pet dogs and teaching them to be obedient, but why go through the trouble of teaching our species to learn physics, math, and writing?  Maybe they would like to provide the best possible living arrangement for us and install some form of simulation where we can live in peace with other life forms like us because that is what makes our species the happiest.   What if they determine that humanity is happiest when there are still discoveries and advancements to be made, thus providing hope to each and every one of our existences. This might result in them lovingly putting us in a place where we can learn and discover all the mysteries of the universe all over again, another earth perhaps.

It's not like we're not having 1/infinity or after-infinity because it's so absurd or ridiculous - The concept is not any weirder than squareroots of negative numbers. If there was a reason to have after-infinity, all we would have to do is to define it, like we defined imaginary numbers that sure as hell will never be found in our empiric world.   We don't have after-infinity because mathematic conventions say that it doesn't exist, because we don't need it and because it's not part of the mathematical system that has evolved over the times.   Yes, the concept of something ""after infinity"" can only ever be contemplated in a theoretical concept, but no, that's not the reason why it doesn't exist in math."	1430439017	2	0	0	0

Breakfast at Tiffanys, I think it was.  I lost count on how many people, mainly middle-aged men, who simply said 'I don't read' in a pretty brusque manner. Dude, it's a book, and a pretty good one, and I'm giving it to you for free.

AskReddit	PM_ME_YOUR_KHAJIIT	between the ages of 7 and 14, I had almost nightly nightmares regarding kidnapping, murder, and rape, because my father let me watch shit like law and order svu as a child. The worst one were when I'd be held down and I'd have to listen to the sounds of my friends, my very young sister, or my mother being beaten and raped. I still get flighty when I hear certain people screaming because of that connection.   Nowadays, I have recurring dreams about some really stressful topics. One that rolls around every month or so is both my parents dying and having to fight my abusive grandmother for custody of my sister in court. Things that involve death in the family happen infrequently. between 13-15ish, lots of dreams where I'm forced to turn tricks, or someone I know is, and those were horrible. Some about being buried alive.  My formative years were very paranoid and not very happy.	1430439062	2	0	0	0

AskReddit	Rather_Unfortunate	&gt;We do understand it.  No you don't:  &gt;Evolution= Something came from nothing, on accident.  The Theory of Evolution says nothing whatsoever on the origin of life. It requires that life exist beforehand as a prerequisite, and does not suggest a mechanism for life to begin in the first place.  So I will repeat: *no you don't.*  If you have genuine questions and would genuinely like to know how it works, then as a Biology graduate and a Masters student in Ecology, I'll be happy to answer them and promise to be more respectful and neutral than I am in this post. But let me reiterate once more: with a statement like that, it is absolutely clear that you do not know what the Theory of Evolution is about, and thus are not currently in a position to submit a meaningful opinion on the topic.	1430439065	2	0	0	0

I've recently read about European Union regulators laying down groundwork for antitrust charges against google. They claim google acted abusively in terms of attempting monopolization of the market. Similar to the 1999 case against microsoft case, they are being compared. Microsoft was found guilty and forced to change their ways paving the way for Google to take over the market. Criteria used was lack of technological change in the foreseeable future and lack of substitutes. Airlines are in fact part of a rapidly changing market, they are changing as fast as search engines change, even on a quarterly basis.	1430439083	1	0	0	0

AskReddit	Gankstar	* Tornadoes since I was a kid.   Just random places and a storm comes and a tornado is near.  Havnt had one in a while but have had so many I typically remember my other tornado dreams while in my dream.  For some reason this has never caused lucidity however.  I normally just run to the basement or hide the best I can.  Couple times I was driving.  Never died and always survive the tornado.  * Lightning &amp; Cracking horrific thunder.  Always starts off with an approaching storm.  Dark clouds.  Then some very strong lightning/thunder in the back ground.  As the lighting gets closer its is naturally loud and its frequency increases.  Toward the end of the dream it is just immense cracking of lighting blasts at intervals around 5-10 per second.  * The floods.  I used to dream about floods.  They were weird.  The location changed.  Sometimes I would be on a beach house.  Once was a house on the beach with glass windows.  Might be in my home town nowhere near the ocean.  Where ever it was water would start coming in.  Small waves at first.  Maybe ankle deep waves.  Then they get bigger and deeper to where I would have to retreat or go inside.  The waves would just get bigger and the water deeper like it was a fast rising tide.  They could crash into a house or fill a field I was in.  What ever scenario I was in it ended up being tidal waves from the ocean I couldnt escape.  Weird thing was after one of them huge Tsunamis that happened in the 2000's I never had the dreams again.	1430439140	2	0	0	0

I'd say more wars are a result of empire-building and maintaining, by different groups at different times.  This is, of course, not to say that religion has not been used to commit terrible atrocities, but only that it cannot be seen as the cause of more war than any other ideology or goal. 	1430439171	10	0	0	0

He may have the power and privilege to gain free drinks without such being seen as a down payment on a night of physical pleasure, and he can just walk away.

Being recognized for what you do is good because it motivates you to create a name for yourself, even if its as small as rescuing kittens.

AskReddit	sunset_blues	Eh, I get your point, but I'm just saying that I have done well despite teachers probably saying things like this about me, and even if they think their bias isn't apparent, kids can tell how someone feels about them. Young kids have a way of internalizing the perceptions of adults and making such judgements on them can actually really damage them.	1430439233	5	0	0	0

AskReddit	Andrew_Waltfeld	I'll take a stab at the question since slideforlife... provided such a dumb explanation. Men get replaced all the time in leadership positions in one way or another. Mostly because again: In these type of positions the question is: ARE you capable of meeting your job requirements always? Yes/No. If the answer is No at any point during your job, then you get replaced.   When you are in project management for example (millions of dollars on the line), you cannot simply be replaced for 9 months while pregnant. No way in hell will anyone ever let you into that leadership position. You can't simply swap the project management manager out like a cog and expect everything to go smoothly. It simply doesn't happen. You have deadlines to meet. Your job *is* that project.   Unfortunately, I've seen and heard of men get replaced because they had asked time off for the first couple of months when their child was born. The company made bullshit excuses of course, but you know the real reason why. Money. When you have these type of high value projects on the line, either you make damn sure you aren't distracted during the length of the project or you get replaced. That's just how it is. That's why women are having a harder time getting into higher positions especially in STEM related fields. Most of those higher positions involve projects where you can't simply disappear for 9 months and expect to have a job after. AFter you finish that project, you move onto another project and so on. Hop project to project. 	1430439258	1	0	0	0

AskReddit	shesallover	"I think the idea is, the pounds you are over or under your ideal weight, will benefit you more if you are over. I could gain 60 pounds and I'd be 180 pounds, and have something nice and soft to sit on for once. I could suffer severe illness and have a greater chance of a faster recovery. I'd stand a better chance of surviving a serious car accident, statistically, as well as childbirth. At 180 pounds, I would survive longer during cold water exposure if I was in a boating accident. I could still bike everywhere, and be shit at stairs. I'd be fat. It would be fine.   If I lose 60 pounds? I ded.   No seriously. I would *be dead*.   So being overweight has more benefits than being underweight, pound for pound, yes.   That's not ""pro-fat propaganda"" that's just ""Your body can deal with being overweight more than being underweight"" Plenty of peeps out there are 320 pounds and still alive.

The ladder method was singular for all cops, which doesn't work. A 110 pound female cop will probably draw her weapon if a 175 pound gangster was preparing to fight her, whereas a 175 pound male cop might be more inclined to use a baton on that same gangster. It just means that officers are allowed to use any force option available to them, so long as other similar officers would also use that force option. Its from Graham V. Connor.	1430439320	2	0	0	0

AskReddit	Satanarchrist	&gt;If they would bounce  When a bouncy ball hits the ground, it starts to deform, and flatten. It looks kinda like the earth does, when compared to a perfect sphere; the equator starts to bow out. As the ball compresses, it stores more and more potential energy. Kinda like a spring, the more you compress it, the more it resists beign compressed. Until all of the kinetic energy from fallling is A) converted into potential energy and B) wasted energy transfered to the ground. That's when it bounces back up. The issue with a huge height like the Empire state building is the physical limits of the rubber. It's only going to flatten out so much before it tears itself apart trying to flatten out more - The larger that equator becomes, the more the the rubber is getting stretched, until it rips.  If I was at work right now, I'd model a sphere in SolidWorks and figure out the spring constant for deforming it. I don't really want to pull out my machine design book and derive it using Castigliano's Theorem (but you totally can if you want). After that it'd be figuring out the terminal velocity of a bouncy ball, and then with KE=(1/2)mv^2, we'd find approximately how much energy is being stored in the ball on impact. I'm not sure how much would be lost to the ground, though. Then some stress-strain equations to see if the rubber could withstand stretching as much as it would, and bam! you'd know if the ball would bounce or not.  And we'd know the kinetic energy on impact, and if we knew how much was lost, we could set up KE-PE=E(nonconservative), figure out the potential energy, and then using PE=mgh, find the height.  I remember seeing a video on ants, and how they can't die from falling; they weigh so little that they reach terminal velocity after like 3 feet. So I googled how much a bouncy ball weighs (11grams), and it makes me wonder if the ball would reach terminal velocity quickly enough to survive the fall. I know a bouncy ball outweighs an ant by a factor of at least 50, maybe 100, but it's still entirely possible it would survive	1430439326	1	0	0	0

AskReddit	verytinyapple	Not a teacher but my friend got mono and missed most of 7th grade, when she came back she was so behind the teachers had to teach her independently. Me and my other friend would go with her during lunch to her tutoring session with our science teacher just so she wouldn't feel awkward or alone, the tutoring sessions were fun and light hearted so we definitely didn't mind. One day I decided that I wasn't going to go to the lunch session with her because I wanted to go to the field and play with other friends and the teacher told my friends that i was obnoxious, not funny, and that i didn't need to come everyday. It was probably the meanest thing anyone in middle school ever said to me, especially since i considered her a teacher i respected and appreciated since the four of us had a close relationship. then, we see gave us unassigned seats in class the next week so my two best friends sat together in the back and she made me sit up front... I don't understand why she disliked me so much to this day... Why are the adults that act like middle schoolers the ones teaching them? 	1430439342	2	0	0	0

In the college I attend, even in-person classes have everything online, so skipping class on non-test/presentation days (and the 45 minute drive) and just doing the work on my own is my preferred method of taking those types of classes. It has yet to inversely impact my grades.  Granted, I did skip too much of a class in high school because I had some pretty bad anxiety/self-esteem issues that the teacher made horribly worse. I failed that class. Somehow, though I still managed to completely avoid the food service (and customer service) industry.	1430439387	1	0	0	0

The combination of Fox's popularity and extremely rightwing opinion shows results in it being attacked much more often.

Both, however, have happened over the same time period while entirely sober.  I rear ended a woman while it was raining, caused no damage, while sober.  Was speeding when I didn't know the speed limit(of 15MPH...) and got snagged by the fuzz, while sober.	1430439415	1	0	0	0

AskReddit	fhsd4264	"Okay, I might sound stupid here but I hope you at least read this.  I don't think gravity is a ""fact"". But then, I am interpreting fact in this case to mean ""is true and will always be true"". For all the data we see everyday, when we are on the Earth's surface (or near it), when we let go of something, it tends to go down. For all we know, one day we will let go of something that has always fallen to the ground, but for some weird inexplicable reason it will go up. Given the current data, that seems extremely unlikely, however i think it is certainly within the realm of possibility. I think what is fact is the phenomenon that any given thing I can let go of will drop to the Earth because it is observed for that point in time and will always be true.  In contrast, I think evolution is a phenomenon, but the theory of evolution is just a theory. For all we really know, there will be a point where we just all stop changing. Again, seems unlikely given current data and the size of the current data set... but hey.  Granted, I think that you are sort of avoiding ""reality"" if you choose not to ""believe"" in gravity and the theory of evolution because that's honestly our best explanation. It's like refusing a parachute when you go skydiving because even though the number of people who have survived with a parachute greatly exceeds the number of people who have survived without, and then jumping based on belief.

AskReddit	IAMYourReason	a) CS has a shitload of cheating going on b) Some CS curricula teach functional prog first, which if done purely functionally has no mutable state i.e. no variables c) You sometimes get paradigm-shifts in intro prog, i.e. the first two semesters might be an OO language like Java or a hybrid language like Python where the notions of declaring variables are a bit different than something like C. Also the terminologies vary between these languages.  I'm not saying it's excusable to be in a third-semester course not knowing how to declare variables, but these are some ways that it can happen.	1430439435	7	0	0	0

AskReddit	bdnicho	Typically the employer will withhold a certain percentage of your pay check depending on how much you make, how many dependents you have, and if you have any relevant tax credits.   At the end of the year you'll get a form (W2) that sums your total earnings and total withheld for taxes. Then, you compare that value to how much you should've paid for the year and either pay the difference to the IRS if your employer didn't withhold enough, or get a refund for the difference if your employer withheld too much.  Normally you can ask them to change the withholding amount up or down. Just keep in mind that at the end of the year you're responsible for paying the amount required. So if you drop your withholdings down then you'll take home more per paycheck but you'll have to come up with a lump sum to pay the difference by the tax deadline April 15th.  10% sounds about right for a part time job and no children or other accrued tax breaks.	1430439440	1	0	0	0

AskReddit	caw81	&gt; But the thing is, when the host removes all the other cards but the correct one, you know with 100% certainty that one of the two remaining cards is the correct one. The odds of the card you picked at first being correct are 1/52.  Because its fixed at 1/52 even when you remove the other cards.  But the other card (that you didn't choose and remains) has its odds changed when you remove the other cards.  Why fix the odds of the one you choose and change the odds of the card (or set) that you didn't choose due to the same event (removing cards)?

AskReddit	Crocs_with_socks	I started having this crazy vivid wedding dream when I was around 5 and had it on and off for ~10 years. I haven't had it for a few years though. The first time I dreamt it I had never actually BEEN to a wedding so I don't know how I had gotten it so accurate but it was the exact same thing every time. basically it was a wedding on some windy hill somewhere and I was there with my family. I remember everyone who was sitting around me's faces perfectly although I'd never seen them before in my life. It's just a regular wedding when I notice the wind starting to pick up, and then I start to hear a bunch of dogs barking far away. The wedding continues like normal, like no one can even hear these goddam dogs barking their heads off. The dogs get louder and I can't even hear what anyone is saying anymore. This part always made me really unexplainably anxious and I asked my mom if she heard the dogs too. She replied but I couldn't hear her over the barking and the wind. I was freaking out so I got up and ran to the parking lot to hide in our car. In the strangely empty car park was only our car as soon as I reached it I glance back and see a lone really mangy dog just sitting and staring at me. The car is locked. I wake up. 	1430439466	6	0	0	0
AskReddit	SawJong	It's great that you've set yourself boundaries for safety! I googled it a bit and I found some contradicting information. I would assume that it varies state by state also. If you are committed to a mental institution, you will lose your guns. But if you are just getting some medication / therapy, according to some you should be fine while others say that it's not a clear-cut issue. I would recommend posting to some pro-gun subreddits as they know much more. Try /r/progun for starters.  It's also good to remember that hobbies are just hobbies. Your mental health is much more important than any hobby could ever be. Trust me, getting over depression and losing a hobby is much better than keeping your hobby but losing your mental health.   Try to get some help, if not from a doctor, at least from an online support group. There are lots of those even here on Reddit and many outside of it. 	1430439466	2	0	0	0

With Yosemite(10.10), however, they changed the behavior, so now the maximize button does make the window go full-screen, as most Windows users would prefer, and the old behavior is available if you hold the option key while clicking the maximize button.	1430439501	1	0	0	0

AskReddit	noposters	Just because you don't understand it, doesn't make it BS.  There is a difference between the price at which you can buy a stock and the price at which you can sell it. That's how a 'market maker' makes money, off this difference, or 'spread.' Historically, the difference between these two numbers could be 1% of the stock price, or more.   Now, because of high frequency traders making it easier to execute trades for everyone, that spread has narrowed tenfold. That means it is much less costly for anyone that transacts in the markets to do business. They essentially made the system much more efficient and took a lot of money out of the pockets of Wall Street	1430439534	4	0	0	0

AskReddit	chipbloch	Okay, let's do a quick rundown of this.  First, we need to make a distinction between the two kinds of law in the Bible. There's the Moral Law, which is found mostly in the Ten Commandments, and the Ceremonial Law, which is found mostly in the Book of Leviticus. The Moral Law focused on things that were sinful and went against God, while the Ceremonial Law was designed to set the Israelites apart from the rest of the pagan world and mark them as the people from whom the Messiah would come.   The Moral Law is made up of things like don't kill, don't steal, love your enemies, and don't commit sexual immorality (in any form). The Ceremonial Law has a lot to do with practices that pagan cultures used in improper ways, such as the command against tattoos (Lev. 19:28). Tattoos themselves are not inherently sinful, but they were used in pagan worship rituals, so God forbidding the Israelites from getting them was an attempt to set them apart.   When Jesus lived, died, and rose again, the Ceremonial Law became defunct. The Israelites no longer needed to be set apart, so the Ceremonial Law was now unnecessary, just like how you don't need to hang up posters for a concert after the concert is over.   Since the Moral Law was created to make people aware of their sin, it still applies, and this is why murder, theft, and sexual immorality are still forbidden by the Bible. The Ceremonial Law no longer applies, which is why, in Acts chapter 10, God commands Peter that all animals are now considered clean. In various places throughout the New Testament, the disciples and Apostles tell people that they no longer need to follow the Ceremonial Law.   Now, there's overlap between the Ceremonial and the Moral Laws. In both the Old Testament and New Testament, homosexuality is mentioned as sinful (Lev. 18:22, 1st Cor. 6:9-10), so homosexuality is clearly condemned under the Moral Law. Because the Ceremonial Law is defunct, Christians are no longer required to punish the sinful acts, but the acts themselves remain sinful.   For another example, consider the adulterous woman in John 8. Jesus tells her that her actions are sinful, but prevents the crowd from carrying out Old Testament, Ceremonial Law judgement on her. The act is still sinful, but the judgement is no longer required.   The reason Christians are able to eat bacon-wrapped scallops dipped in cheese is because there was never anything sinful about the act, the commandment against it was merely to separate the Israelites from pagan cultures around them.   TL;DR: Two kinds of law in the OT, Moral and Ceremonial. Moral is sinful, Ceremonial is not. Homosexual activity is part of moral law, dietary restrictions are not. 	1430439583	10	0	0	0

AskReddit	Moal	"Not a teacher, but when my sister was in elementary school, she was a little overweight (she's fit now) and very self conscious about it. She was bullied a lot for being ""fat"" and didn't have very many friends. One day in the 6th grade, her gym teacher weighed everyone in class, and he made her go first. And then, to my sister's horror, he announced her weight to the *entire* class and made a really rude comment about her weight. She said the class kind of sneered and snickered at her and the bullying got worse for a bit. That gym teacher didn't announce anyone else's weight. Just hers. "	1430439590	62	0	0	0

In my APUSH class, our teacher had been making some really sexist remarks. I had only been half listening so I can't really tell you then verbatim, but it essentially led to one of my girl classmates telling him, ""If you were my age, I'd slap you so hard right now.""  Almost immediately, as if he had been waiting to say it for a long time, he nonchalantly replied back,  ""If I was your age, I'd be on top of you in the back of my truck right now.""  The worst part is that he still works there. The school can't bring itself to fire him, and he's gotten away with so much shit like this. "	1430439607	1239	0	0	0

AskReddit	beardedheathen	"&gt; I go on reddit and I'm constantly reading comments by users who believe that people who speak using dialects like AAVE are dumb. Ironically this opinion, at best a misunderstanding of linguistics and at worst a manifestation of racism and elitism, serves to make the users themselves seem like unrepentant idiots.  This whole post which takes his comment and attempts to redraw it in the worst possible light is the very definition of a strawman argument. Instead of actually responding to what was said he misquotes the original and then uses that as an attack rather than trying to discuss or even debate.   I, personally, feel like ebonics evolved from a lack of education in proper English and that is probably why the first poster said that. The question wasn't: ""What one sentence makes a person stupid"" but was ""what makes you view them as stupid.""   Also claiming that calling someone out for incorrectly using the language of the country you and they are living in is ethnocentric is pretty dumb. "	1430439634	-1	0	0	0

I have not heard of any serious talk about classifying the Moon as a planet. It perfectly fits the designation of a satellite of our planet. The satellites Titan and Ganymede are both considerably larger, larger even than Mercury and almost Mars, but there is no serious movement to change their classification either.

AskReddit	TheGomp_	For me, and as most people have said, I don't dislike human interaction.  It's just when I've reached my limit of exhaustion, and people still want to interact, I start to get frustrated, and want to have some alone time.  I have a pretty small, tight friend group that spends most of our time talking online, or in person, but there are days when I want to just hang out by myself, and watch YouTube videos, or movies.  That causes some tension, because they obviously want to talk to me because we are friends, but they end up stressing me out with how hard they press me sometimes.  It's not like I can't hold a conversation with other people, but after a decent dose of social interaction, I need some time to recover.	1430439682	3	0	0	0
AskReddit	chevron_seven_locked	"Because getting beaten up doesn't typically strip you of your bodily autonomy.  Because getting beaten up doesn't typically have the potential to force a pregnancy or STD.  Because getting beaten up is typically an external phenomenon.   Have you ever talked to rape victims, or read their stories? Rape is *excruciatingly* personal. Often victims are smaller or physically weaker than their rapists, and unable to fight them off. Often victims are threatened with death, and forced to commit devastating acts in order to live, such as telling their rapist that he/she is ""the best they've ever had"", or performing oral sex. The events of rape physically and psychologically plague many victims for years.  Rape is a comprehensive, internal and external violation of bodily autonomy. Rape tells the victim that their autonomy (often tied to our sense of self and independence) doesn't matter.  Look at how much shame comes with rape. ""She shouldn't have gone walking around in that outfit at 2am."" ""She kissed him first, so she led him on."" ""He had an erection, clearly he wanted it."" These messages tell victims that they deserved it. Furthermore, rape victims whose bodies exhibit sexual response, such as erection or orgasm during rape, send even more confusing and shameful messages.  Assault is terrible, getting beaten up is terrible. Nobody here is challenging that. But to say that rape is no different frankly sounds very ignorant."	1430439683	6	0	0	0

AskReddit	bracketdash	Well, I went to a commuter campus, and lived about 20 minutes away. This one morning, I think it was a Tuesday, I got into my car and drove to campus. When I arrived, I couldn't park in the spot I usually do because someone had already taken it. I thought that was really weird, but then I noticed a lot more cars were parked in that lot than I usually see this time of morning. So I check my phone to see what time it is. You know, to make sure I didn't accidentally sleep in. I was alright, so I found a parking spot a little further back, and get to class. Then I start asking around about why so many more people were on campus today, and nobody knew why. I was wondering about it all through class, and when it was finally over, I was walking in the hallway on my way to the cafeteria, then I saw it. There was a flyer on the bulletin board for a special event. Some kind of highschool college campus visit thing. Apparently they have these every once in a while, or maybe once a semester or something, where parents will take their high school kids to campuses of colleges that they think their kids might attend once they graduate. I'm glad I solved that mystery. Pretty crazy story.	1430439698	2	0	0	0

AskReddit	beer_is_tasty	Purely accidental typically isn't a crime, but killing someone through negligence, though without intent, is. For example, if a kid runs out in front of your car and you don't have enough time to stop before running over and killing them, it's not a crime. But if you were driving drunk and hit and killed someone, you can be charged with manslaughter, even though it certainly wasn't your intent to hurt anyone.	1430439792	3	0	0	0

AskReddit	nicotineapache	I have a friend who is 29 years old and was in my science class (2nd top group) but the bottom class for maths. He was easily distracted and a bit annoying (despite being a good friend of mine). Loved WWF (when WWE was WWF) and was a bit daft. Did nothing after school and you'd think was going nowhere. He's on an access course and about to start an astro-physics degree.  I'd tell him I'm really proud that he's doing that, but I don't know if that'd add pressure or whatever. You just can't predict somebody's potential like that at a young age when there are opportunities later down the line.	1430439865	1	0	0	0

However, many white collar crimes end in settlements because the prosecution knows the evidence they have may not hold up in a court. An since those cases are criminal they deserve the same scrutiny in court as anyone else does, that is, having the burden of proof on the prosecution.  If it is a civil procedure, they can settle or the court can assign partial liability for the charges if the evidence is not strong enough. 	1430439891	1	0	0	0

AskReddit	douglasg14b	Lets calculate this shall we?  A marble has a diameter of ~2cm, this gives it a volume of 4.189cm^3.   Neutron star material has an averaged density of 3*10^26 Kg/Km^3. (https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/xte/learning_center/ASM/ns.html)  * 300,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 Kg/ Km^3 (~50x the mass of the earth) * 300,000,000,000,000,000 Kg/m^3 (3*10^17) (~The mass of [Prometheus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prometheus_\(moon\))) * 300,000,000,000 Kg/cm^3 (~3x the global biomass of all fish or ~30x the biomass of the entire human species)  Each marble will have the mass of 1.2567*10^12 (1,256,700,000,000 Kg)  10,000 marble-sized neutron stars will have the mass o1.2567*10^16 (~ the mass of [951 Gaspra](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/951_Gaspra))  The terminal velocity of a sphere 2cm in diameter, and with a density of 3*10^11 Kg/cm^3 is: 348,640,771m/s, or 1,255,106,777Km/h. This is probably broken, I doubt the math is supposed to work with objects with that kind of mass, lets assume it accelerates at 9.8m/s^2 for the entire fall and does not reach it's terminal velocity. (this is also ignoring the movement of the earth towards the massive object).  The empire state building is 381m tall, the object will be traveling at 86.4m/s by the time it hits the ground.   **It will impact the ground with 4.6906*10^19 joules of energy, or 11,211 Megatons of TNT. This would be 224 time larger than Tsar-Bomba, the largest nuclear explosion ever. According to nukemap this is the size of the affected area: http://i.imgur.com/TDnfMGe.png**   I would need someone with more knowledge to calculate the energy released by that much neutron star material turning back into w/e matter it would turn back into since there is not enough gravitational pressure to maintain it's current state of matter.

AskReddit	mightysquirrell	I had this dream often when I was a kid, then it stopped, but I had it again about 6 months ago, which was really odd  In the dream, I'm with my 4th grade teacher and class.  We're in the middle of a flat, endless desert - just dry, cracked, yellow dirt as far as you can see in every direction, sun beating down, no clouds in the sky. There is a wooden ship (sort of pirate ship style) that is in front of us, partially buried in the sand, old, weathered, no sails any more, just one mast still standing. Since we're on a class field trip, the teacher leads us up some stairs onto the ship, which has just an empty wooden deck, except there's a white stove in the middle and there's a big burly chef, muscular, with his sleeves rolled up and big hairy arms, a big cigar in his mouth, chef hat on and white dirty apron, red bandana around his neck, and a spatula in his hand. He's cooking something in a skillet, and the teacher and the rest of my class gather round to watch.  I stay back and look around, and that's when I see a knot hole in one of the deck boards.  I go up to the hole and I get down on my hands and knees and press my eye to the hole, and under the floor boards there's a skeleton staring back up at me.  I fill with panic and the dream ends.	1430439931	1	0	0	0

It's all of these blacks.""  I pause for a minute. This man is Sicilian. I'm white, so I'm guessing he thought that meant I'm automatically of the same opinion.  A black student walks up and asks some things; this kid must have heard some of the conversation. Mr. C answers him.

Essentially what this means is that he's taking the integral of sec(x)/cos(x) (finding the area underneath the curve of sec(x)/cos(x)). He then proves that the area under sec(x)/cos(x) is equal to that of sec^(2)(x) and solves using an identity to say that the indefinite area under the curve is equal to tan(x) + c (where c is any real number)."	1430440004	4	0	0	0

AskReddit	FriskyArts	Because it was bred by a man who had a couple illegal wolves and some other dogs, including an American/white shepherd. This was a neighbor of one of my mom's friends. The guy had warrants out in several states and was in hiding, so our future dog was starving and killed another neighbor's chicken. He said he was going to shoot her when he got off work, and when my mom found out, we drove out there and rescued her.  Some of the guy's other dogs were adopted or put into shelters. Several of the vicious ones, including the two wolves were put down. I'd upload pictures, but I don't have any and would need to dig them out at my mom's house.	1430440008	1	0	0	0

EDIT: [Here](http://www.clinchem.org/content/59/3/478.short), [here](http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/adb/27/3/854/), [here](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0001457512002709), [here](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13181-014-0393-4#page-1) and [here](http://www.bmj.com/content/344/bmj.e536.abstract). It's just from a quick scholar search, so I'm struggling to find the full articles, sorry, mostly abstracts. But there's plenty of research out there, and the consensus is pretty clear.   Anyway, regardless of what the studies say, you'd have to be an idiot to think that being high isn't going to affect your driving. You know that it reduces reaction speed, reduces the ability to multi-task and affects cognitive reasoning. These are all reasons that people smoke in the first place, it's great to chill out on. You don't want to be super chill when driving, you want to be alert, aware and relaxed. 	1430440013	3	0	0	0

AskReddit	barristonsmellme	"At no point has anyone suggested you stop tipping. The staff won't be punished by it in the slightest. They just get to live happily like every other member of waitstaff world wide in the knowledge that they have a base pay, that when they go the extra mile, the reward isn't just to help add upto their wage but is the bonus it's meant to be, and if the bonuses don't come then they are atleast still on minimum wage.   A million people can have a million arguments on the matter but nt one single argument will top the ""Pay your bloody staff their wage!"" one.   Do not for a second think that the world thinks the problem is that American wait staff get tipped. Everyone get's tipped.  The problem arises in the fact that those tips have to subsidize their wage. that they are not being paid by their manager the bare minimum pay. That when people think ""Oh that was good service, they'll get a tip"" that it's just expected because where else will they get *their wage* from.  People will not stop tipping servers. But how can they possibly be content in tipping knowing that they're paying the servers what they should already be getting paid anyway?   It's absolutely disgusting.   Think of any minimum wage job.   You do the work, you get the hourly rate which is low enough as it is.  Now imagine you only get paid a fraction of that and have to rely on other people to pay you your wage. That is not how it works!   there is no socio-economic agenda behind what I'm saying. There is no grand idea or movement i'm trying to start. this is not a rallying call to maybe implement a new system. It's just the argument that bosses should pay their staffs wage, not the generosity of others. "	1430440016	1	0	0	0

AskReddit	TheEmaculateSpork	CNN is shitty too, but the mistakes they make are less obvious than Fox news. Like one I remember in particular, they were reporting a story leading up to the Beijing Olympics and it was about Chinese police beating protesters, yet the picture clearly showed that the officer was:  1) Not Chinese as he was very dark skinned.  2) Not wearing a Chinese police uniform (it had some other language on the badge)  Turns out the police was Nepalese, but most Americans won't catch that if they just look at the news. Whereas Bill O'Reilly exclaiming that we don't know how the tide works is clearly bullshit to anyone with half a brain.  So yes, CNN also misinforms, but it's usually less obvious than Fox. And I don't really think it has a liberal bias, if you want to see liberal bias look at MSNBC, and even they're not as bad as Fox. Mostly American TV news is shit, the only news source I really trust in the U.S in NPR.	1430440049	0	0	0	0

AskReddit	Madock345	In the actual Lovecraftian mythos, Cthulhu is pretty far down the totem pole. He's an ex-slave who learned a little of his master's magic, got a big head, and tried to lead a revolution against the Elder Gods. This got him and the other Great Old Ones banished to other dimensions or sealed away in the earth. He's still way more powerful than a normal human, but more because of his psychic abilities and magical knowledge than his physical power. He was still asleep when the boat hit him, so most of his powers and defenses were offline.  He got popular online because he actually has a describable physical form, where most of the Lovecraft creatures don't, he also had three stories about him, where the others got one each. A lot of the more crazy shit people say about him would be more accurately attributed to the Elder Gods.	1430440064	1	0	0	0

AskReddit	hippiebanana	As a European, I do tip in the US, and I think everyone is responsible for researching local customs before travelling anywhere - but I would also come at this topic feeling like the European way is superior because frankly it is. You earn a liveable wage, and often get tips on top if you do your job well (even if you don't sometimes - I think many Americans think tipping is totally unheard of here which is blatantly untrue, it's just most often directly related to service). You will always, always make a reliable, consistent income as long as you work the hours, which will always be minimum wage (which is also much higher in Europe) or above.   Also, tipping in Europe means something because it's not compulsory. Tipping in the US is a way for businesses to cop out of paying their employees properly. I don't think that thinking the European way is better gives me a free pass from tipping in the US, or taking out my problems with the businesses on their employees. But yes, sorry, but I do think it's superior for tipping to mean something and for employees to be paid properly and fairly for the work they have done.	1430440080	4	0	0	0

We were supposed to go out to dinner then meet friends, but he said he forgot his wallet at his place and would I like to come up to see his apartment- to which I agreed.  We get up to his apartment and he starts asking if I'm into Astral Projection, and saying its the most liberating thing. Asking ""Do you want to try it? you could try it now, I could lead you..."" I kept saying ""It really isn't my thing, I'm not really into that spiritual stuff.""  He had given me a drink and kept saying drink up then we'll go, but feeling a little freaked out, I said I needed to eat before I drank anything. Later found out he was hard into hallucinogens.  Dunno if he just made me a drink or was so fuct that he thought he'd liberate me with an outer body experience whether I wanted one or not. He never once tried anything sexual either, so I think he really just wanted someone to trip with him.     "	1430440121	1	0	0	0

AskReddit	GetOutOfBox	How can they put fourth an effort when nothing can be done? There is literally nothing that can be done by police officers. How are you supposed to put out an APB for a stolen bike? Most bikes look pretty much the same, and require very specific descriptions to differentiate. Then, even if an officer found the bike with someone, how are you supposed to prove it's yours?  It's not like this problem only happens to bikes, pretty much any kind of property theft works out this way. Police certainly don't organize huge busts trying to find things like a PS3 or diamond ring. Pretty much the only property police are able to retrieve with some success is cars, because they are something you can't hide as easily and they have unique identifiers easily visible (the license plate, and if it's removed there are lots more discrete serials hidden throughout the components).	1430440123	1	0	0	0

AskReddit	prsplayer1993	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_the_European_Union#Religiosity  Northern/Western Europe is between a third and 18% religious. Though it's not a majority, i'd certainly not say it's a real minority. Similarly, the percentage professing some level of spirituality, when combined with religiosity, still outnumbers atheism for the most part, so I'd argue feeling in northern and western Europe is not laughing at the religious.  Anecdotally, as a resident of the UK, it's quite rare to be ridiculed for my own faith.  Also, the UK, Germany, France and Belgium are hubs of the scholarly study of Christianity (a community of which I am a part). For good scholarly research to take place, an outlook of ridicule is generally discouraged, otherwise you end up with unscholarly twaddle like *The God Delusion*.	1430440146	-1	0	0	0

AskReddit	the_cox	I was told by my math teacher in 6th grade to not pursue math, and I overheard her speaking to a colleague saying that I was a clear candidate for the lowest level Math class we offered in high school.  End of the year, I got an award from the state for getting one of the highest scores on the state math competition, repeatedly, over the three or four months that we filled out the tests for them.  So, yeah, take that, Mary.  Not only that, but in high school, I am not in the lowest level math course, I am taking the highest level of physics (something my first year physics teacher told me not to pursue) and also the highest level of Chemistry.  I even received honorable mention on the state chapter of the American Chemical Society's Chemistry Olympiad.  Despite this, and the fact that I am in the most challenging high school in my city, in the most challenging classes available to me, and am not doing poorly in them, I was denied from Purdue Engineering.  Oh well, I have backups, and that wasn't my ultimate goal.  Their loss.	1430440207	1	0	0	0

Same triangular build and material. I see a hole open in the top and a ball drops in. Instead of falling, the ball circles around the sphere as it slowly comes down. The second I look away from the ball, I look across from me to see one of those scrambler rides. The ones that spin its arms in a circle while three seats attached to the arms also spin in a circle but in the opposite direction. On it, is a damn marionette. It's dressed as a cowboy and aims a shiny gun at me and right as he's about to fire it, I look for that ball again. It's feet away from me and it's about twice as big as I am. The puppet fires his gun and the ball smashes into me. I wake up and I am full on sick. This dream I have had every time I come down with anything more than a cold. The first time was when I was 6 and had pneumonia. 	1430440209	1	0	0	0

AskReddit	HardlyWood	"My ex boyfriend (we stayed very much in touch) passed away less than a year after we broke up. He was going through a divorce and had two children when we dated. I connected with some of his lifelong friend after his passing, and learned quite a few things about him.    From patchy comments and stories he would never fully elaborate on, we pieced together a history of rape by his father from a very young age.   I also learned that he was essentially entrapped by his wife. He had been friends with her as a teenager (he was 40 when he passed) and she was obsessed with him. She got pregnant with their first child because she stopped taking her birth control, and she convinced him to marry her. From what his best friends say, he never really loved her. But when we dated, he told his friends all about me.  Throughout him begging me to go out with him, through our on-again, off - again relationship, he was totally smitten with me.  Even at his memorial service, his wife said he would have done anything to be with me. His father introduced me as his true love.  He always told me ""you don't understand"".  I've never felt as completely loved by anyone before or since him.   But honestly, I hope he gets some peace now.  He was truly a tortured soul, and did any kind of substance to dull the pain. Even though his two wonderful children are without their father, they have an amazing mother to love and support them, and they don't have to go through the constant tumult of his life.  I miss him.

This is changing now as there is increased immigration into European nations, but in the case of people whose families have been living in one country for hundreds of years, they tend to look very much like their countrymates.   Americans tend to be mutts, mixed from all the people who immigrated to America over the years. Most white people are combinations of Irish, British, German, French, Italian, and a bunch of others they don't even know. If you look at them and try to guess their ancestry it will be pretty hard, since they look like a mix.   TL;DR: If you can't tell where someone is from, they're American. If they're white and have a strong look that reminds you of people from a certain country, they're probably European. "	1430440231	23	0	0	0

Some of the elite senior high schools are very competitive to get into, but plenty aren't.  It also provides a pathway for poor but bright kids to get into a good university without a private education.	1430440239	17	0	0	0

AskReddit	SouthgateJenny	"People disappear after the baby's born. No one talks about the loneliness after a baby's born.   The constant criticism and one-upmanship you'll encounter from other parents. Not long ago, I was playfully telling a (younger) former high school classmate, ""We're getting old!"" after she posted something about how long ago we graduated. Barely skipping a beat, she gets back to, ""Well, I feel even older than you because I have TWO kids."" Uh...didn't know our kids were involved in this?  The constant drive other parents can have to complain about their kids is exhausting. Don't get me wrong: we all need to vent. But some of them make it an Olympic sport. It's frustrating. I don't want to be rude, but I get tired of hearing it. But if I express that, I'll get looked at as that ""uppity"" parent.   If you're a mother, your days of not being picked apart are over. Every relative has some kind of comment to make: don't you think he's too cold? That baby makes too much noise! There's something wrong with him! I think he's hungry (based on no evidence whatsoever). I know as soon as I leave my in-laws that they are running their mouths about how I care for my son. It's emotionally exhausting being around people you know are going to nitpick as soon as you see them. My own family doesn't do that."	1430440241	173	0	0	0

I decided to go over their head and asked the principal to allow me to take the courses. I passed all of them. I'm now finishing my fourth year at a UC and am staying a fifth to complete my second major. Anyone who tells me that I can't do something is someone who I don't want backing me.

AskReddit	droth420	In a sense I can agree with you. Weed can be dangerous. For example, it can be abused. A non experienced toker can smoke to much weed and get too high, and let's say that same toker were to operate a motor vehicle, well chances are he's probably going to crash that car. Like anything, it should be approached with caution I 100% agree. But overall, is marijuana honestly safe? Absolutely. Don't be an idiot about it. Smoke responsibly. It all depends on the person. I personally do not use heavily anymore simply because it isn't to me what it once was. But I'll be damned if I won't try to spread the word of this wonderful plant sent from God almighty.

AskReddit	Mulva9	Oh, please. You have no idea what you are talking about.   Via Up-To-Date:  Diagnosis of acute gout — Patients suspected of acute gout, in whom the diagnosis has not been previously established or in whom the cause of acute arthritis is uncertain, should undergo arthrocentesis; testing of the synovial or bursal fluid should include cell counts and differential white count, Gram stain and culture, and examination of crystals under polarizing light microscopy.  Blood tests — During an acute attack, blood tests may show nonspecific changes consistent with inflammation; the uric acid level may be high, normal, or low. Serum uric acid (sUA) levels can be difficult to interpret during an acute gout flare. For example, in the early months of urate-lowering drug therapy, gout attacks often occur with normal or even low serum urate concentrations at the time of the acute event. Lower urate levels have also been proposed to result from effects of cytokines during flares. Overall, normal to low serum urate values have been noted in 12 to 43 percent of patients with acute episodes of gout [48-51]. In patients suspected of gout based upon the features noted above, an elevated sUA (≥6.8 mg/dL) can lend support to the diagnosis but is neither diagnostic nor required to establish the diagnosis. 	1430440283	1	0	0	0

Suddenly all infrastructure is primitive and barren, like all buildings are turn of the century style and there's nobody around. Its a beach city, but suddenly in the dream large parts of it are flooded. And I'll start to walk along this one particular beach that is up against some cliffs when all of the sudden the waves become huge and I'm running trying to find the trail up the cliff. Obviously I get that ""running in sand"" feeling, the wave crashes on me, and either I wake up or end up in a dream where I'm in a random bar/club with a bunch of people I've known but haven't seen in years, and most of them I had a falling out with in real life.  Somebody I don't know comes up to me and tells me that I'm in the collective conscious, and that this dream is being shared by everybody. I start trying to make amends with the people, kafkaesque conversations ensue, and I wake up. It's actually a bad nightmare, I wake up every time I have it shaken and depressed.   Sorry about the wall of text, on my mobile. But these two dreams always happen with each other. I have a couple others, but this is the main one. "	1430440288	1	0	0	0

AskReddit	NapoleonTak	Idk. Not all smokers smell like smoke or have their sorroundings smell like smoke. I also hate the smell. Especially when you walk into a house or car and just immediately smell cigarettes. If you smoke keep it away from others and hopefully have enough self respect to be sure the smell isn't everywhere that you linger. Of course your kids shouldn't suffer because of your smoking. A person who keeps the smoke away from their children of course already knows this BECAUSE they're keeping it away from their children. So making sure you blow the smoke outside the window and keep your children out of the room doesn't make you dumb. It makes you smart.	1430440291	0	0	0	0

No it doesn't work out to sexual attractiveness as well, but women can create worth in their lives.    I'd say the true disadvantage is the developmental loss that comes from starting out on an easy level.  Men run the gauntlet and are told from day one that they will only be worth what they achieve.  But women don't start getting this message until later in life when there's less chance to grow in that crucible of doubt.	1430440337	6	0	0	0

Substitute teacher was caught holding a severely autistic student against the lockers by his throat. This was after the student was having a negative behavior and the substitute tried to roughly pull him off the floor. The sub? Slap on the wrist. Why? Former district aministrator. Parents? Had their wishes granted because the district wanted to avoid being sued.	1430440339	1	0	0	0

AskReddit	Sleela17	&gt;I have no problem with the police identifying a driver as intoxicated, or unable to drive in their current state, and taking them off of the road. But that person should not be punished by the law if their intoxication did not cause any harm to other persons or property.  I kind of see where you're coming from, but I just don't agree with this. People are punished for drunk driving because they made a decision that could potentially harm or kill others. They are not being a responsible citizen. I mean, what you're suggesting is akin to saying that restaurants should be legally able to serve outdated or contaminated food and should only be punished if it actually makes someone sick.  &gt;Why can't I crack open a beer on my own front lawn, without getting the attention of a passing police office, and possibly getting arrested?  ...why would you be arrested for drinking a beer on your own property? Maybe it's just because I'm from redneck country, but I see people doing this all the time.	1430440348	2	0	0	0

A scientific theory is a fallible hypothetical model that has been thoroughly tested and has yet to be disproved, wherein fallible means it is something that *can* be tested, and model means a set of reproducible patterns by which we understand a certain phenomenon and which can be used to make predictions about similar phenomenon.  God and the mythology surrounding Him is a hypothesis only, and it is an infallible hypothesis, meaning it cannot be tested against evidence. One can make a claim that He exists, for example, and never have the possibility of being proven wrong or right about it.  I could go on if you wish.

AskReddit	inuredhalcyon	When I was a kid, me and my family lived in a house that was, to say the least, unsettling. That's a different story, though. But we lived there till I was nine, and every single night I had the exact same recurring nightmare--it's actually my first memory, too.   It started with a dollhouse type of view; a three-story home split down the middle so you can see all of the rooms. It wasn't our house, by the way. I was in the living room on the bottom floor, and my Mom, who wasn't my Mom, told me she was going to go upstairs and take a shower. The second she got upstairs, the front door exploded open and two shadow men, one tall and the other slightly shorter, both wearing some type of hat, like a 40's or 50's style, came in and kidnapped me. I screamed and fought and yelled for my Mom, but they were too strong. I'd grab onto the door frame to try to hold myself in, but my fingers slipped every time, and that was it. I woke up. I was so scared of that dream and that house, that I spent every night either sleeping on my parents' floor, or in my brother's room. 	1430440397	1	0	0	0

Storing excess calories as fat actually takes another step making the body spend energy to turn the excess calories into fat. And a big reason as to why people gain the weight back is because they set goals and when they achieve the goals they go back to their old normal eating habits, forgetting about the diet. 	1430440398	7	0	0	0

AskReddit	Mr_Fifths	"I'm civil. I don't mean to insult I was literally just trying to show you my own experiences. Many countries over here have a majority of non-religious or atheist population. I know in America atheists are seen as edgy teenagers but over here it's seen as the norm.   Now you have to understand that this means that there are whole countries where over 70% of the population does not believe in God or that Jesus rose from the dead or that Noah's Ark actually happened.   Because of this growing up we learn about America, where in some states the majority of the population believe that a man built a large boat and filled it with two of every animal. Now that's pretty absurd to me. So we laugh. We also laugh at the idea that there are adults who believe in an invisible man who created the world in 7 days.   Do you see my point? I'm in my late twenties and I don't know of a single person who believes in God. It's not that we constantly laugh at you, we just don't ever think about God. But when someone says, ""in America they think that Adam and Eve actually existed"" we find this quite funny. I don't mean to insult you. It's just how it is. "	1430440412	-2	0	0	0

This stahp gave me cancer for science, so that's enough internet for me today. OP is a fuzzy little man-peach, 2/10, would not bang. What is this I don't even know how is this wtf? Circlejerk must be leaking. This will get buried but brace yourselves, some men want to watch the world burn right in the feels. When you see it, they'll KILL IT WITH FIRE! But this has nothing to do with atheism. Lawyer up, delete facebook, hit the gym, and SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY, said no one ever, so you wouldn't download a strawman. Damn onions, you scary like a BOSS. whoosh. Since rule #1 is 'be attractive', I'll just leave this here: This is my [f]irst post, be gentle. I have the weirdest boner right now. /thread.

AskReddit	patientpedestrian	I mean, it's kind of weird. When I'm driving for delivery, I'm getting payed to do it and it's in a fairly small area with easy roads and few unexpected frustrations. It's not as boring as sitting around in the restaurant waiting for tables to bus, and I can listen to music or NPR so I actually really enjoy my job.  In pretty much every other context though, driving just feels like a really annoying chore. Plus I don't like being forced to stay sober when I go out to have fun just because I have to drive home at the end of the night. I can't wait until cars can drive themselves. 	1430440443	1	0	0	0

AskReddit	measureinlove	For a while, I had similar occasional dreams about a friend/ex of mine who died—for the first couple of years after he passed the dreams were always sad and occasionally scary. But for the past year or so, whenever I dream about him (once every few months or so) it's usually been a nice dream where we just get to talk and be together and I usually wake up feeling both happy and sad. I like to think he's watching over me, and forgives me for not being the greatest friend the last few years of his life. =\	1430440445	2	0	0	0

AskReddit	adi_jumbo	I just had this dicussion with my 15 yo daughter. Wanted to get her thoughts after reading some stories about TransG kids in different schools. She said she doesn't care at all. The bathrooms all have stalls, so who cares? The locker room is a different story, but she thought the person could use the 'handicapped' shower where there is a curtain, so no one would have to see a dingaling. I personally think that the major issue is women are brought up to be so modest, and it can be a challenge to realize when someone is a perv or legit Trans. True pervs (especially teen boys) would go to great lengths to see some teen TnA in the locker room. 	1430440456	2	0	0	0

Newtons model and Einsteins model don't contradict each other. They complete each other. Newtons model is less accurate than Einsteins models but it is way easier to calculate and gets the job done for most space crafts. That is why it is used, Einsteins models would take supercomputers and too much time to calculate the space craft orbit. 	1430440467	2	0	0	0

That isn't to say that a scientific theory can't be proven incorrect, however it does mean that they have evidence to back up what they're saying.   God, Dieties and most ""mythic"" elements of any religion are, but their own nature, a subjective phenomenon. As such they cannot possibly be measured.   That's not to say that God or another religions primary diety isn't sitting in a literal Heaven, or whatever one might believe.  The important part is His (or Her, or Its) existence cannot be measured in any way.   So, it's inaccurate to say ""a theory of God."" Theories, by definition, are proven fact until proven otherwise.

AskReddit	ajones102030	women like to feel like a man is in charge. We like that safe, yet attractive security. If a man asks you out first, he's being dominant, which is quite attractive (at least to my standards). Girls are told by society that we need to be the submissive ones. Girls normally don't ask guys out, so we prefer to stay within the social norm. However, to encourage a guy to ask her out, a girl would flirt with him to let him know she's interested.	1430440494	1	0	0	0

When we were cleaning out his stuff we found his birth certificate. Low and behold he was born on December 30th. He hated parties so much that he always lied about when his birthday was, so that he only had to celebrate one. My mom even thought his birthday was December 31st. He lied to his own children.

All he wanted to do was drink. Here we were newly weds and he slept on the couch. Didn't even want to sleep in the same bed and gave me some bs excuse. And everything was always my fault. He never spent anytime with me or our daughter when were we there but it's my fault I didn't stay. You know how many times he's passed out on the floor, dog bed, chair or wherever? And when we had friends over too! How embarrassing! There's so much more and I could go on. I left again and I'm done for good. And come to find out his ex that I didn't even know was his ex was at our wedding and my baby shower! And he's been seeing someone less then a month after I left before he even knew I wasn't coming back! If you supposedly love me as much as you claim you do how am I that easily replaced?

AskReddit	AtomicTruth	USA  1. Legalize adulthood.  * Legalize all drugs. Your body, do what you want with it.  * Legalize prostitution. Your body, do what you want with it.  1. Socialized medicine for all citizens. There are many reason this makes sense. The pros far outweigh the cons.  1. Term limits for senators and representatives. I think 6 years seems about right.  1. Serious campaign finance reform. It shouldn't cost a bazillion dollars to get elected to office. How you do it, I don't know, but there is far too much money/corruption in politics.  1. Let us vote online. Give us a Tuesday off (National voting day) every 2 years. Maybe a tax credit for voting. Maybe someone passing out a free Big Mac coupon as you drop your ballot. Something to incentivize more of us to take the time to vote.  1. Fix our courts and prison system. Mandatory minimum sentences and corporate prisons are just ridiculous. Stop incarcerating people for drugs. You're not solving the problem, you're just making it worse. Treat drug addiction as a health problem. Spend those billions on drug education and treatment programs. Those actually work. Throwing an addict in prison does nothing for anyone.  	1430440552	1	0	0	0

I sneakily walked over to his side of the tub and let him have it. But hey, they used to gargle urine to clean their teeth in the old days, so I guess I was actually performing a service to him.

AskReddit	Jaymez82	The reason I have an AS is because I couldn't handle the math portion of my program. I retook Pre Calculus 3 times and still didn't understand it. CS, at least when I went through it, was heavily focused on programming. I was never interested in programming, but, it was the only tech program at my school at the time.  IN my experience, on the support side of things, advanced math is rarely required. I'm sure those that build the networks need to worry about understanding hex and proper subnetting, but, I don't. While I have to make sure the device is on the proper subnet, I don't build the networks so I don't need to know how to do it.  I would love to get into server support, but, I currently work for a very large, multi national, corporation and all the servers are in another state. There is a LOT of department segregation in my company and moving up through the ranks of the IT department is very hard to do if you can't drop everything to relocate when a position opens up.	1430440622	1	0	0	0

AskReddit	thecarolinakid	My great-grandfather was born in 1913 in the US to Polish immigrant parents. In 1914, his mother visited Poland, taking my great-grandfather along. She dropped him off with the upper-class couple for whom her father had been a gardener while she visited friends in Warsaw for a few days.  Unfortunately, in those few days World War 1 broke out. Separated from his mother, my great-grandfather and his caretakers went on the run from the fighting, using silverware to bribe their way past soldiers who had been instructed to round up anyone with soft hands (working people would have calloused hands, wealthy people wouldn't.)  In 1922, the political situation was settled enough for the US to begin extracting American citizens stuck in Poland. My great-grandfather and his mother were reunited and returned to the US, only to find that his father had died several years ago. My great-grandfather had no schooling and didn't speak English. His mother made enough to send him to school until he was 12 or 13. Then he dropped out and became a busboy in order to support his mother and himself. He eventually taught himself enough about mechanical maintenance to get a stable, decent paying job at a telephone company.He got married, and over the years saved up enough money to send his three kids to college.   	1430440660	2	0	0	0

AskReddit	OddDice	The set's odds do not change. They are still 51/52. The only two possibilities are that you picked the right card, or that the card is somewhere in the other set. If you did not pick the correct card the first time (and we know what the odds of that happening are), it will, with absolute certainty, be the other remaining card. Therefore, the odds of the other card being the right one are still the 51/52 from the first choice.	1430440666	1	0	0	0

AskReddit	sashathebrit	My mum is a university professor, and I attended her uni (never her classes) for two years before I transferred. It was a smallish campus so being the social butterfly I am, I knew a lot of people, and because my mum is a gossip and straight-up bitch, I also knew what marks they were getting, if she suspected they were taking drugs (of course they were), and if they were going to be dismissed at the end of term.   She also talked a lot of shit about my professors, including one who was brand-new and had no real idea what he was doing yet, and after getting fed up for her hundredth rant about his teaching skills/social skills/lack of professional dress code, I let him know what she was saying, who agreed with her, and that I thought it was all a load of shit.   To clarify: he taught me more in that class than I learned in all of my others combined, I always found him to be pleasant and approachable (if not a bit weird but he was in the sciences so it's pretty par for the course) and his daily uniform was a dress shirt and slacks.  In the six years since I attended there, he's become one of the most popular and requested professors, and she gets consistent reviews that she's rude to students, condescending, and always unavailable for office hours. I don't get on well with my mum.	1430440685	1	0	0	0

AskReddit	bracketdash	It went well, if a little awkward (when is it not, am I right?). We had been dating for about 6 months at this point, and we knew we were serious about each other, and we had already talked to each other's respective families a lot about each other. I can't remember what the occasion was, though.  Neither of us was at all anxious. I actually was looking forward to it because I knew it would be fairly entertaining (my family is very conservative, hers is very liberal), and that nothing our families did would affect our relationship very much.	1430440688	1	0	0	0

AskReddit	designut	Oh man, that is just terrible - I am so sorry to hear you've had such a hard time! Has your MS been diagnosed as degenerative, or is it more episode-based?   Question: does anyone in your family have it? They keep flip flopping between whether it could have a hereditary link or not. My husband's dad had MS and my mom has MS, and we're expecting our first child, and we have always worried that it could turn out to be genetic.	1430440691	1	0	0	0
AskReddit	StiltzkinTheMoogle	I dated the same girl 3 times over 5 years. There was never any animosity between us, we just wanted different things out of life.  Dated for 2 years, broke up, saw her at a party 6 months later and fooled around... dated for another year. Broke up, saw her at *another party* a year later, fooled around (alarm bells are ringing, dumbass) and dated for 6 months. Then she moved to New York and I haven't seen her in 10 years.	1430440691	1	0	0	0

AskReddit	[deleted]	Let me just clarify I haven't seen anybody that denies the holocaust happened entirely. AFAIK the common belief is that it's greatly exaggerated and there was no death camps and most deaths came from when the Allies cut off supplies.  Roughly? [After WW1, Jewish newspapers started saying 6 million.](http://www.thetruthseeker.co.uk/?p=24369) [Josef Kohout said that camp commanders would watch gay men be flogged and masturbate.](http://forum.codoh.com/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=7669) [Auschwitz had a swimming pool usable by inmates.](http://www.rense.com/general24/controversy.htm)  It's likely that survivors that deny the holocaust are paid off. If you look into it, you will see something doesn't add up.  See [this comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/34ffo5/what_one_sentence_can_someone_say_to_make_you/cquelgp) and [TGSNT](http://thegreateststorynevertold.tv/)   History is written by the victors.	1430440695	-12	0	0	0

There can't really be a number that is the closest to 1 without being it, because you can *always* add another digit... Unless you have infinitely repeating digits. 0.999... = 1.	1430440752	1	0	0	0

AskReddit	anime_wars	This semester I just helped a classmate with her homework, and she didn't know how to do this either. What blows my mind is that it would have been required knowledge for a previous class. With homework assignments. I more or less gathered she just googled solutions to the problems assigned from the book and copy/pasted them.  Then again, I occasionally hear about people applying for programming jobs that can't do a simple fizzbuzz problem despite having a college degree.

When the books started getting harder I just couldn't read them. I spent a miserable week inside every break and lunchtime after I failed to read a word in a book. I had no idea what it said, I couldn't read it out. My teacher told me to stop acting stupid and read the word. I begged her to tell me what it said and she refused. I had to sit with that book in front of me all week because no one would help me. The word was ""because"".   I was tested some more and put into a class with the special needs kids for English class for two weeks. In that time I was taught how to read and suddenly I was reading at a higher level then the other kids in my class.

AskReddit	LandauTST	I never had a recurring dream until recently. In 2005, I was basically kicked out of the house by my stepdad and had no other choice but to move in to my grandmother's old house which was sitting there for some time. It was starting to get run down and needed major work done to it that I couldn't afford. On top of that, it was in a horrible part of town. I always had my windows covered and felt like a prisoner in my own house. I had to get rides when I wanted to get anywhere because my cars had trouble more than ran. I lived there for 8 years before finally moving to a different place with my girlfriend 2 years ago.  But ever since I moved out, I still have nightmares that I still live there. Even if the focus isn't the house itself, it still plays a part in a majority of my nightmares. Like, if something bad is happening in my dream, I'm living back at that house. But a lot of dreams are just me living back there and dealing with the same things I used to when I live there.  I do suffer from anxiety and depression, so that probably plays a big part of it. Even when I think about it or even have to drive past it, I get anxious and am uneasy about it. Place friggin' haunts me.	1430440786	2	0	0	0

AskReddit	maddhattin	"You don't ""get even fatter"" however your body does start working extra hard to conserve which makes your attempt at weight loss that much harder. That is proven science. This principal is why the 5-2 alternate day fasting diet is so effective. By the time your body realizes you are taking in less calories than you need to sustain your weight, you are back to eating normal intake the next day. So the ""starvation mode"" thing never kicks in and pounds drop off at the rate of about 1 per week. Source: I dropped 15 pounds in 4 months.

AskReddit	MappleSaucee	correction: YOU'VE never clearly visited tumblr or you follow the wrong kind of people  For one I go on tumblr way more than reddit in the first place and I know a lot of reddit just shits on tumblr for the select minority that bitches way too much about feminism and stuff like that. Yeah, thats still a select minority of people on the site, and you choose who to follow and get posts from in your dash. I've only seen one post with exaggerated feminism and I immediately unfollowed. Never got any posts like that again. Same logic goes for the current context. I've yet to even hear of someone stupid enough to claim being overweight is healthy. A lot of body positive stuff supports people who are comfortable with their body size, but I've never seen anything saying being overweight is healthy... That has to be just an exaggeration, or maybe just one or two articles said that.  In any case, I may be wrong, but it's not like a lot of people on Tumblr think that way. I'm not saying there are no stupid people on the site, either- going on /r/thathappened for a few minutes can easily disprove that.   	1430440861	0	0	0	0

During the year you would earn money doing whatever tasks or jobs and you could make purchases (erasers, pencils, etc.; it was a little store) or not throughout the year. You would record them in your check book and balance it. Well at the end of 6th grade we would have a huge auction to spend all of the money you had saved up on really cool stuff. Anyways, it was awesome but I never again saw any financial responsibility activities like that after elementary school. It's a shame. 	1430440878	1	0	0	0

One good thing about American produce compared to Asia was that in America it's possible to get anything year-round. In Asia if it wasn't in season it was hard to find and prohibitively expensive. On the other hand, the produce that was in season was very cheap, and there were markets selling fresh produce every few blocks it seemed. In America there are major urban areas where there are only convenience stores and no fresh fruits or vegetables available for miles. 	1430440958	1	0	0	0

A young female teacher, very pretty, most students have a fairly open crush on her. It's her first year out, she has an asshole male teacher pull out of a sex ed class, so she has to cover it.   Of course, it's the one class where she needs to put a condom on a banana.

Leave sex out of the equation (ok, it's reddit, but at least try) and think about romance. Imagine describing dating to a kid. ""What, you just have dinner together? That's boring"". But if you're having dinner with your crush, it's the most exciting thing in the world.   That's why being a parent is so cool.

Which one night of sleep when you haven't had any in 5 days, is a beautiful thing. I think I slept for 18 hours.   Up until recently, I've always had good luck with medical tests and hospitals. When I was younger, my mom worked for a hospital in a lab and when I was really sick was able to rush me there and I got expedited care from the emergency department.   With my wife being a med school student, I was able to get expedited care at the hospital she was doing rotations at.   Also having really good insurance has gotten me much better care than those without when I've gone to the hospital.

""The Secret of Kells""- wonderful children's animation.   ""Kagemusha""- Kurosawa's ninja movie.     ""Manhunter""- Michael Mann makes a wonderfully 1980s Hannibal Lecter film. Later remade, less memorably, as ""Red Dragon""   ""The Producers"" ""High Anxiety"" - did I mention I am only listing films available as instant?   ""Event Horizon""- wonderfully scary 1990s horror   ""Assault on Precinct 13""- 1976 John Carpenter version. Suspenseful crime movie.   ""The Cabinet of Dr. Cagliari""- classic 1920s German expressionist Horror.    ""The Conversation"" by Francis Ford Coppola. This film said everything about the NSA a decade before Ed Snowden was conceived. Amazingly prescient. Also ""Bram Stoker's Dracula""- incoherent, badly cast, but a cinematic smorgasbord of filming techniques.   ""Chinatown""- Roman Polanski. Hate the man, love the film.    ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"" - Terry Gilliam. One of his lesser films, but still a delight.     "	1430441040	1	0	0	0

AskReddit	Pock_the_Viking	I'm smoking a bunch of weed at a packed music festival  that seems to go on for miles. I'm always wearing a track suit covered in blood and mud. I either dance with girls  or I'm beating people up and getting beat up. For some reason everything is in super slow motion, and I always get shot by someone in the crowd and I wake up.  I don't smoke weed, go to music festivals, or fight people in real life.

He told thirty 14 y.o. students they would get Ebola from people sneezing in public places. I broke my assistant's code and told him and the class that was incorrect, right then.    The teacher and I googled it after class, and while you might get it from a really spitty spray-like sneeze right in the eyes or mouth, it's super unlikely, hard to transmit and he was just scaring the class for no reason.	1430441080	1	0	0	0

AskReddit	IgnoreMyName	Not a teacher but a substitute teacher told me I was going to die early because I laugh too much (and too loud). It was a free day in Law and Society so we generally played board games. There's this one game where you move around a board and pick a card from 2/3 decks that have random questions on them. Questions asking about plans in life or what do you think about _____? There's no winner, just pick up card based on where you land and answer.  Anyways, me and 4 other friends goof off in class constantly and this was the perfect board game for us. We answered every question with something relating to sex, porn, and dicks. We're having a good time and the subs looks over, calls my name, and tells me that I'm going to die from laughing too much. She's playing solitaire. I try to laugh as much as I possibly can so I don't die from an accident or something like cancer. Go out while laughing, call me the Joker why don't you.	1430441147	0	0	0	0

AskReddit	an_obvious_comment	My junior year of college I was studying abroad in Shanghai. The nightlife in Shanghai is absolutely insane, especially being an American. Western culture is pretty trendy in China, so club promoters would set us up at tables and give us free drinks just to get us in their club. We took advantage of this as often as possible.  So me and my friends go out to some club where the promoter was going to waive the cover and set us up. I drink as much of the free whisky as I can. Naturally I get pretty hammered. Also, I really gotta piss. So I looking for the men's room.  Now keep in mind the bathrooms in most of these clubs are set up in a lounge layout. So you would have a men's lounge and a women's lounge, each with stalls lining the walls. These lounges can be very difficult to distinguish between, especially drunk.  Naturally, I stumble into the women's lounge. As I realize my mistake, I feel someone grab my hand a pull me into a stall. This Chinese girl proceeds to unbutton my pants and gives me one of the best blowjobs of my life. When she finishes I immediately begin asking her if I owe her money (assuming she was a prostitute), she just giggled, shook her head, and left. I was dumbfounded.  TL;DR: That time a Chinese girl I didn't know sucked me off in a club in Shanghai.	1430441160	1	0	0	0

Whatever was happening in her mind she was not able to understand that when you do a mathematical operation you can get an answer that's less. She wouldn't even just add instead she would just answer with basically random numbers.   Even after just getting her to count backwards 2 digits from 5 she would say something like, and I shit you not... 5, 4, 3 and then write down 6 on the answer sheet.   She wasn't my student but another tutor's so I don't know how she turned out at the end of the year but I was there to witness the above 5-2=6 event.

The difference is a professional chalks it up to teen angst and doesn't hold it against the kid for being a dumbass and does they're best to keep the kids ignorant of your true feelings by still treating them the same and giving them the benefit of the doubt for their behavior and shortcomings.  It's foolish to think teachers should for some reason not think about people the same way everyone else does.

AskReddit	wegethungry	"I really would love some insight on this. This is completely truthful and I know a lot of people will find it interesting. As a kid I had a recurring nightmare which became somewhat of a ongoing joke to tease me within our family because of how funny it sounded to others, but it seriously did play on my fragile mind. The villain inside these spine-tingling nightmares was none other than the much loved Ronald McDonald.  The majority of the time they would start out like this, I would wake up in my bed and hear my name being called in such a terrifyingly soft tone, somehow I always ended up running down the stairs and just as I had hopped the last step I would be frozen whilst parallel to our porch which was closed off by a wooden door with translucent glass. Without being able to move from my frozen state and being inches away from the porch door, my head would involuntarily turn to the left to face the translucent glass, behind it would be a red and yellow figure haunting me.  For years and years Ronald McDonald had become the catalyst of my nightmares or would show up to sabotage my pleasant dreams, more often than not they would all begin in the manner described above. But something happened which made this whole saga even more interesting...   I have always been able to remember the final dream, not vividly, but something out of the norm happened and it changed everything. Finally, rather than running from Ronald I decided to stand up to him and ask him why he'd been haunting me all these years, I'm sorry to say I can't remember the response my mind fabricated but it was at that very moment the tormenting stopped, and the ""nightmare"" ended somewhat pleasantly. Since as far back a I could remember he'd leave me petrified of facing him every time I went to bed and just like that, he stopped.  A while later, it could have been a few years, I had my last ever dream in which Ronald played a part. It wasn't scary, I wasn't frozen in time, he was just a part of another unique and completely nonsensical dream which unraveled like any other. That was the last time I ever saw nightmare Ronald, it's very strange and I think about it a lot. I can't help but wonder about some kind of deeper meaning behind all of this."	1430441286	1	0	0	0

AskReddit	anschelsc	Homelessness, including child and teen homelessness, has been rising in the US for years. In many big cities (I think most) there are considerably more homeless people than there are beds in shelters. While all poverty is bad, homelessness can be especially hard to escape because without a home it becomes near-impossible to apply for a job, register for benefits, cook (necessary to eat healthily on food stamps), or keep yourself decent-looking (necessary to get a job).  If you don't care about the people, it's also worth noting that, because they tend to get health problems and are unemployed for longer, dealing with the long-term effects of homelessness is usually more expensive than it would have been to just give people free housing.  You can help by advocating for city, state, and federal governments to help homeless people and help prevent at-risk people from becoming homeless, and by donating time or money to the private charities that try to make up the difference between what's needed and what the government provides.	1430441288	1	0	0	0

AskReddit	pandasweater	About once or twice every few years I have this dream.  As a child my mother once took me to Pocahontas on Ice, which was my absolute favorite princess, and I would constantly sing the songs the brits would in the movie.  In this dream I'm 7 again and we're at Pocahontas on Ice. Everything is going OK until this older larger woman is upset with me for some reason. She is yelling at me through out the show, and so we try to find different seats. Everywhere we go she finds us and kicks us out. (I guess she was staff). For the entire show we're moving around and I never even get to glance at the ice rink. At the end I always end up crying because I single handily ruined everything and I know my mother's going to lose it on me later.   Every time I have this dream I wake up crying. I'm 22.  There's also another that I've had ~4 times since I was 5. The older kids in the neighborhood were all eating these bright neon bead thingys with a swirly tail (? I don't know how to explain it) coming out of it. Well, if you eat these you become a werewolf and my parents said only bad kids ate them. But the teenagers were having so much fun! They would sell them, pressure me to eat one, at the end of my dream I've resisted many, many times--yet everyone around me is a werewolf. I always wake up before I give in. And it's always an extremely scary dream for some reason.	1430441321	1	0	0	0

AskReddit	EntropyNZ	It's really only the more 'extreme' branches of Christianity (most of the U.S./Bible Belt forms of the religion I suppose) that hold the bible in such a place of reverence.  If this is something that frustrates you about other members of your faith, then remember that the Bible is only a book. It's there as a reference, and to provide a moral framework through the stories and parables that it contains. If you follow a religion, you should follow the teachings and overarching message of said religion, your holy book is just there as a reference.  Not religious myself, but went to a Catholic school, and Bible Belt Christianity is barely recognisable as a branch of the same religion now.	1430441345	1	0	0	0

Don't ask how I forced myself, I just wanted to get better and leaped towards the only branch I saw.  I did anything and everything I could that would give me a natural sense of feel good.  I played video games for the first time in a while.  I drew.  I organized something.  I cleaned a thing. I cooked a food in the oven, AND on the stove.  I did these things like my life depended on it, because I knew it did.  I didn't want to continue the cycle, and I knew I could break it.  I just didn't know how, so I tried all the healthy things that made me feel good.  I'm not sure what you can do with that advice, but I hope it helps.  I hope you have a realization along the lines of ""I haven't done X in a long, long while"" where X is the set of things that you used to enjoy.

AskReddit	ReallyPuzzled	Apathy is what makes democracy fail. The *act* of voting is essential for the democratic system to work. The reason why unpopular candidates get voted in sometimes? Their supporters are more motivated than apathetic people who don't think their votes count. If every eligible person voted we would *actually* see how the democratic system is supposed to work and get a realistic representation of what the people want.   I'm a historical researcher and it really upsets me when people (especially young people such as myself) don't take advantage of the privilege we have. Less than 100 years ago women couldn't vote, and so many countries today are having wars over democratic freedoms. With so many important issues and inequalities still prevalent in North American society, I don't understand how anyone could honestly think that not voting is an option.  It also takes 30 seconds and is free.	1430441361	1	0	0	0
AskReddit	thor_a_way	It is crazy to see the way the culture in the U.S is going. I agree it is really sleezy to wait until someone is drunk or otherwise not sober to try to get them to consent, but to say someone is not resposable for their actions because they were drunk is straight up bull shit. If that same girl consented to her desire to go driving while drunk, would the girl be absolved because she wasnt able to make good decisions? Many people use alachol for the inhibiton lowering effects, and maybe the girl is too shy to talk to that guy she has been interested without alachol. Tellung a woman she is not capable of making decesions once she has been drinking should be offensive to the woman.	1430441361	2	0	0	0

The pages that I found dispute all your claims.  If you have better sources, I have offered to spend my time reading them.  It is you who are lazy.  .  &gt; the government can and did [force banks to offer mortgages].  The government asked GSEs to make **regulated** low-risk thirty-year **fixed-rate** mortgages more readily available.  This is not the category of mortgages that burst the housing bubble.  .  All the trouble was caused by **unregulated** high-risk, **adjustable-rate** mortgages, driven by Mortgage Backed Securities.  The government had no control over these mortgages.  That was part of the problem.  It is you who are wrong.  .  &gt; As to your last point I said you absolve people of their responsibility.  My initial post said that banker got off scot free.  The guilt or innocence of the people who lost homes is moot because they were punished when they lost equity.    .  Each individual homeowner was responsible for just one mortgage.  Foreclosure on any single home could never have burst the housing bubble.  The banks were involved in *every single mortgage* that failed!  The banks are the common denominator and therefor responsible. 	1430441361	1	0	0	0

Shoes usually last me eight months before the cushioning goes bad.   2. Do foot exercises and stretches once you get home. Rolling a tennis ball under your feet really does help!

AskReddit	sergantawesom	Well we don't have to go trough the trouble of acting on the spot. We can just take a break mid typing maybe watch a youtube vid or something else. Reading something text based is at least for me a bit de-personalized. It also feels like a 1 on 1 session  wich is doable. At a bar there are many people and things are happening around you so it is harder to focus on talking with someone and that is just really draining. This is how I experience it others might have thier own reasons. Hope it awnsered a bit of your question	1430441387	26	0	0	0

AskReddit	newdflasher	When my ex would cry, it literally killed me. Seeing him upset and hurting was awful and I hated it, and it happened very infrequently. But sometimes it felt like his lack of emotions, or his emotions surfacing in anger were harder on him than just crying for a while would be. Like, why not just let it out the way it wants to come out?   I guess I'm just 100% into letting tears happen if they're there, and I guess it is just more universally accepted for me to cry than a dude... but it seems like it kinda sucks not letting it out.	1430441415	2	0	0	0

A scientific theory is a series of statements about the causal elements for observed phenomena. A critical component of a scientific theory is that it provides explanations and predictions that can be tested. Usually, theories (in the scientific sense) are large bodies of work that are a composite of the products of many contributors over time and are substantiated by vast bodies of converging evidence. They unify and synchronize the scientific community's view and approach to a particular scientific field. There are often times when new information is added that changes the theory and even disproves it. That new information is peer reviewed and verified.

AskReddit	R4p354uc3	It isn't even a bad thing either. Some people really shouldn't be going to college. My dad is a drywaller and there is a lot of money in the trades right now because no one is looking for those jobs after high school. Everyone wants to go to college because that's the American definition of success. There needs to be more of a push for students to be targeting specific careers, not just college. You can be very successful without going to college. 	1430441456	2	0	0	0

AskReddit	AReverieofEnvisage	Well it's not recurring really.  About 2 years ago, I had a friend who I was proud to call best friend, I wasn't to him though.  He knew I liked this girl since she started working with us.  I kept trying but I guess she was not interested in me.  Even given me reasons, her religion, she was jewish, I wasn't, income, even though we both worked in a museum.  I had long term plans, meaning I wanted more than a girlfriend, obviously.  So, she turned me down like that.  A few weeks later, I'm riding the bus on my way home.  I see both of them eating outside of an ice cream shop.  I died, it was horrible, I had to turn to face the other side because I was standing up.  He took her virginity, moved in with her, and after 2 months it was over.  I forgave them though, and even talked to them both at work.  What else could I do.  I don't talk to them anymore though.    I dream about her a lot, not about the rejection, but different instances, and not about sex.  Sometimes it's empowering for some reason, like being in a fight having to defend myself, and she comes and hands me sticks and pipes to fight off the attacker.  That was one.  In another, she's there, talking to me in a classroom just being close to me.  Just today I dreamt she was receiving an award, I start clapping and the whole stadium starts clapping as well.  And I give her a standing ovation, and the rest of the stadium follows while I'm clasping both my hands and sorta congratulating myself before sitting down, next to my old friend, and her.    I sometimes think if I'm truly over it, or if perhaps I should look her up and catch up.  I wonder as well if there would ever be a moment where she would be the one to like me, and if I would refuse her for how much hurt I have been through.  	1430441480	1	0	0	0

AskReddit	BCProgramming	"That will introduce a bias into their study.  For example, if we imagine a study that for example took 10 people(for easier visualization), 5 overweight, and 5 normal weight individuals. I can't be assed to look up the statistics, so let's say- 37% of people of normal weight develop alzheimers, (and let's assume our sample is completely average). So of the 5 normal weight individuals, let's say 2 had Alzheimer's disease when they collect their data on their subjects at the end of the study period.   They then go back to find their 5 overweight individuals. Let's say 1 of them had since unfortunately died due to health complications, So they drop them from the study. They find that one of the 4 other overweight subjects had alzheimers.   -In this example, 25% of the surviving overweight subjects (1/4) had alzheimers, and 37% of surviving normal-weight individuals did. Does this suggest they have a 12% lower risk of getting alzheimers? Of course not- the confounding factor is of course the death. the issue of course is that this weights the statistics. I cannot think of a good way, myself, to ""account"" for the confounding factor very easily. Even with very high sample sizes, it is necessary to presume that the factors of obesity that lead to a risk of death are themselves independent of any risk factors that would lead to alzheimer's disease.

AskReddit	dbltrbl_77	Ok so this one is a bit more positive! Just got back with my high school sweetheart about 6 months ago. Dated on an off, I moved states, he had family issues, then I moved back but had family issues...he broke up with me right before prom and we didn't talk for 2 years after graduation (reasonable response for a girl right? Right...) Then got reconnected in the weirdest way imaginable-- most recent ex called my HS ex in an attempt to prove something. Still trying to figure out what. That's just another can of worms.   Anyway, we didn't intent to date again, just started talking. And talking. Hanging out, goofing around (no not sexy time goofing). Then we spent almost a whole day talking about our previous issues, why we broke up, all in a very candid way (EX: I very bluntly called him an asshat for the prom dump, and he agreed hahaha). We figured that the main thing is that we were both rather immature in high school, but got along really well...and now we are more mature, and still get along. Surprisingly well. So we started dating again.   What sucks is he's going into the Navy in 3 months. He's pretty determined not to let me go this time so that's a comfort b/c I intend to hold on to him too. We'll see how it goes!	1430441490	1	0	0	0

She was so pissed off after dealing with the 5th graders that some kid asked a stupid question and she just went on a HUGE rant, calling us all ""Little assholes who don't listen to any shit they're told"" and then left for the rest of the day. We were all so scared by that, we didn't tell anyone a single word. What an evil woman. Not to mention, her mentor was called Ms. Savage...

I have relatively good hearing still, but I notice that low tones and people with deep voices are harder to understand sometimes. 	1430441522	1	0	0	0

AskReddit	Rks1157	I enjoy being sober because I'm free.    When I was drinking and using I couldn't go anywhere unless I could get tight on the way, during and on the way home.  If this wasn't possible I just didn't go.  I often overshot the mark and I became dangerously antisocial.   As the result I had been invited to never return to every bar and restaurant in town.   I was also uninvited to friends homes.  As the result I just stopped having friends all together.  My family uninvited me too.   Eventually I found the circle bar.  Get up from the couch, sway into the kitchen, fill my tumbler with whatever cheap hootch I could afford and stumble back to the couch, repeat until I was unconscious or blacked out.   Life was awesome! (not).  Today I get to go wherever I want.  People actually want me around.  I don't smell like vomit and I know where my car is.   I can answer my phone without worry. I can drive without carefully planning a route and have my eyes on the road rather than the mirrors.     Today my relationships are real.  I genuinely care and I think that those I care about genuinely care about me.  No one has found me crashed out on the floor or front lawn  without my clothes on in many years.  	1430441523	4	0	0	0

Like the other day Oklahoma put to death this guy who raped an 11 month old girl to death.  11 MONTH. not year, month old. And they had hooked him up and werent even pumping anything yet and he started screaming and kicking about how much it hurt and it was burning like acid.  And then people started protesting how Oklahoma puts people to death. Screw that. You want me to feel sorry for you after you raped an 11 month old to death.  He should have had to die a slow and painful death.  Maybe if that is how things were done people wouldnt commit crimes like he did. 	1430441525	1	0	0	0

AskReddit	Big-Package	I don't feel as if this comparison holds up. The Boston Tea Party was a response to Parliament's reducing of import duties for the East India Company to prop the company out of near destruction, but it created a monopoly since the East India Company was now able to import tea straight into the colonies at the absolute lowest prices. The Boston Tea Party was a direct response to the East India Company and a direct action against them. The Baltimore riots are an issue of police action, but uninvolved stores are being burned for it. This does not send a message of any constructive sense, but instead conveys mindless rioting.

Also....  If you endanger others because of any distraction, including both hand-held and hands-free devices, you can also be charged with careless driving. If convicted, you will automatically receive:      six demerit points     fines up to $2,000 and/or     a jail term of six months     up to two-year licence suspension  You can even be charged with dangerous driving (a criminal offence), with jail terms of up to five years.  	1430441592	1	0	0	0

My parents raised us well and did all that they can for us, but he still does stupid shit that they just can't understand.  He found himself in the hospital with a BAC over .35 back in December.  Nearly died.  You would think that would be enough to scare him straight and quit following in the footsteps of his friends.  NOPE.  A month later we have the police detective at our house because apparently my brother took a photo of himself holding a BB gun in a threatening way and a mother was concerned.  Think after being called into the superintendent's office and told that if he keeps going down this track he may lose his scholarship to his university of choice would scare him straight?  NOPE.  Just a few weeks ago he bought a vape for weed and an e-cig.  My parents are at their wits end and can't figure out how to get him in line.  He's not a bad kid, he just makes a lot of stupid decisions.  It's what happens with 18 year old boys.  Just keep being a parent to him and remind him that his actions will affect his future and he needs to see through this.  It honestly just boils down to insecurity and feeling like they're invincible.  He'll grow out of it.  And know that you aren't alone.  I'm sure the mothers of his friends are feeling an awful lot like you some nights. 	1430441672	1	0	0	0

AskReddit	KingOCarrotFlowers	When I was a sophomore in high school, I realized that I absolutely didn't have time in my extremely busy schedule to do the required PE credits. I was taking a lot of honors classes and upper-level math classes, and it just would never fit in my schedule. My sister was the same way, but she was in her senior year, which is how I realized it'd be a problem later on for me, too.  Luckily, my high school allowed you to do your PE credits outside of school. I just had to get a few forms, and when I went to the gym in the evenings, get the person at the front desk to initial my workout times. My sister and I both started doing this program at the same time.    Halfway through the semester, there was a check-up period, where you had to meet with the guy that was the head of the PE department and show him your progress so far. I went into the meeting and showed him my workout sheet, and we talked briefly about what kinds of exercise I liked to do.   Apparently he was unsatisfied with my responses, because after I left, he told the next student in line that he thought I was the dumbest person he'd ever spoken to.   Luckily for him, I didn't hear him say that.   Unluckily, the student he said that to happened to be my sister.   Obviously my sister didn't keep quiet--she told our mom, who is a well respected elementary school teacher in the district. Mom called the principal of the high school--a man she had worked with previously, since he had been the principal at an elementary school she worked at before.   Literally the next day, I was asked into the principal's office, and he assured me that the coach had been dealt with (which I'm guessing means he got a slap on the wrist--he was kind of untouchable, since he was the football coach, and had led the team to the state championships three times in the five years he had the job), and that he was going to waive all future meetings that I had with the coach for my PE credit. I ended up completing the out-of-school course anyhow, because I'm not the type of person to take shortcuts, but I never had to report it to anyone.  	1430441686	0	0	0	0

AskReddit	Zanki	"My Primary School held me down. I basically did the same year three years in a row. I was moved up in year 2 so I could be with the older kids and do harder work, which was great for me. It kept me occupied and quiet in class when I got to do their work. Unfortunately I had this awful teacher who was a complete ass. I was six when I moved into his class. He would kick me out of class for the slightest thing, me answering questions correctly used to piss him off so I would be out then as well. Then he would ""forget"" about me and I would spend entire classes in the corridor. Because of him, I never did any classwork because how could I if I wasn't in the room and he would never give me anything to do outside. This was the same man who would laugh at me and encourage the other kids to bully me. He was evil and I couldn't tell on him because I was the bad kid who made up lies to get out of trouble (that's what mum told me when I told her what he was doing). I got stress headaches because of him. I had him as a teacher for two years. It was hell. Then I heard he was going to be moving to the year 4/5 class and I requested to stay down to get away from him. Some big warning signs should have shown up then when a kid does that, but no, no one cared. He made me out to be some idiot and I was kept down.   The best part was, in my final year there we had to pick our schools. I wanted to go to the nice old grammar school (it just still had the old name), one of the best schools in the area. I got in. The teachers decided to call my mum in to have a serious discussion about me going to that school. They told her that I couldn't go to the high school I had chosen, how I would be expelled within a week, how I should be going to a school for bad kids because I wasn't good enough for normal school. They also all told me how I could never do anything I wanted to do because I was such a bad person, how the school would be better off without me etc.   What was very interesting was when I got out of that school, my grades suddenly went back up to top of the class and my awful behaviour suddenly vanished. Teachers had been told about me and they were shocked and kept asking me what I had done in that other school to get such an awful record. It wasn't me, it was the school. One teacher was so terrified of having me in her class she refused to teach it without a support assistant in there with me. That lasted a few weeks until she realised I was just a little fidgety in my seat (I have a hard time concentrating if I stay still) and I wasn't about to cause chaos or anything. Ok, I had two flames coming from a bunsen burner one week but that was the worst I did and I didn't start that second fire, it was just a broken burner. "	1430441705	1	0	0	0

AskReddit	Lethroblacken	True fat can be an energy source but it is not THE energy source; that is glycogen aka Sugar. When you eat carbohydrates (which should be the primary macronutrient for energy) your body breaks them down into glycogen and then your body stores this glycogen in the liver/brain/muscles. When you eat an excess of what your body needs in Protein or Fat it gets stored immediately as fat. You should try to never go over what your body needs for these for this reason: While if you go over in carbs your body can store the excess glycogen in these sites while also using the glycogen your body needs to function. Now when the glycogen stores are full the excess of glycogen gets created into fat hence another step. The human body is meant to function as a perfect high pace computer so doing another step makes the body slower and expend unnecessary energy. If you do not wish to take my word for it i will be more than happy to explain how it takes energy to change glycogen into fat.	1430441708	2	0	0	0

Europeans who know how it works in the US and still don't tip are assholes.

Rape is a crime that MUST only be convicted with 95% undeniable *EVIDENCE* and lack of it should never warrant even an investigation. Of course exceptions arise, as it "" I was raped and then my rapist bathed me thoroughly and gave me a bleach douche and etc"" then of course it's different than ""Maybe I was raped, maybe I wasn't, yeah I was so ok cops I was raped 9 months ago at a party by a guy who I can barely remember 80% of the time"". Rape is clear, rape is simple, and rape is easy. If you aren't sure you were raped then you weren't. The exception is drugs, which are visible in your system, or *EXCESSIVE ABOVE ALL ELSE AND NEAR DEADLY* levels of alcohol consumption that leave you not ""drunk"" but leave you in unconsciousness and etc. The exceptions don't warrant an all sex in this scenario is rape approach, like our idiotic drinking policy, but encompasses an approach of taking these cases more strenuously than other cases because consent given while drunk but rescinded when sober is false but consent violated while drunk is true rape.   When it happens rape is serious and horrible, no exceptions what so ever. Rape when left unreported and evidence is non existent leading to a case founded on he said she said allegations should not ever be investigated because they can't be investigated and thusly will always come down to a guilty or not guilty verdict based entirely on hearsay.

All these facts make you undeniably dead wrong.  Further, your ignorance creates a BIG moral problem for you since 50-80% of all fertilized zygotes fail to implant and are flushed away, since that's a human/person in your eyes you're now required to force the woman to consent to a search of her discharge using every available medical means and then forcing her to carry it to term, OR, you're guilty of murder through neglect.

AskReddit	Adzmodean	It's something pretty distinctly American and seems to be related to American Culture, and specifically American Policing culture.  In Ireland, the UK, or Australia (countries that I have experience of) that sort of a call would result in General Duties police converging at a safe distance, the Sergeant in charge would confirm how many calls (and content thereof) the dispatcher had received to try to establish veracity, then an unmarked unit might approach to recon the site, if nothing untoward was sighted, a plain clothes detective might approach on foot for a closer look/listen. Finally, a General Duties team might go up and knock on the door and double check if everything's OK. (How tremendously boring for the audience).  Generally, offenders can be split into two groups; those who want attention, and those who very much don't. the ones who want attention make themselves known, the ones who don't can generally be approached without an entire SWAT team kicking in the door.  Yet, from all reports US police are happy to kick down doors into god-knows-what without having even properly reconned the site. It's no surprise that it so often ends badly.	1430441827	3	0	0	0

AskReddit	LVTIOS	I, as a student, found out that my choir director asked around (among my classmates) to try to find out if I was gay, which was a little offensive. Yeah, I'm a little effeminate, and for the record, I'm pansexual, but this was during a period of a lot of emotional turmoil surrounding me discovering my sexuality, and I really didn't appreciate her going behind my back like that and not just asking me.	1430441838	2	0	0	0

AskReddit	chelefr	Back in high school I was dating one of the smarter girl in my grade she was ranked 10th out of 300, I think. Well one day, one of our friends over heard the dean talking about me. He was talking with the gym teacher about how I'm druged loser and that I shouldn't be dating that girl. Well our friends told my ex what she heared. My ex was a boss about it  and confronted the dean. I told her that it was no big deal and that we were about to graduate, and it was kinda true that I did smoke weed, like every day. Anyways next day in lunch the dean came up to me and apologize. He was really scared lol. I told him to not worry about it and that I thought that it just funny. Considering thats what he talks about. I never got angry at him because I just felt sadness for him.  	1430441843	1	0	0	0

Also if it happens again, call the parents... if nothing helps, suspend the student....  edit: whoever downvoted me, do you disagree punishing students for bad behaviour? Why? Should the interested students suffer for nothing and even get bad grades (which will have an impact on their future)?! 	1430441851	-5	0	0	0

I actually really dislike the tradition of men having to ask women out. It makes everything so one-sided. Imagine trying to find someone who fits with your personality based on random people who approach you. I can imagine it's equally frustrating being the approacher. Personally, I've had better relationships when I decide a guy has potential and ask him out instead of vice versa.	1430441878	3	0	0	0

Do you get electricity from coal power plants? People die mining coal, at the plants and as a result of the population. At a HUGE rate. Petrol for cars? Many more there.   Get ~1-5 billion, invest it into better energy sources and you'll save more lives than the 10000-50000 you ended getting the cash.   Edit : I don't care about fame for myself in this. Any money I get from presses would go straight out funding electric vehicles and better power plants. Mankind sacrificed lives for that money so that mankind could survive.

AskReddit	GratefulGrape	There are two kinds of crimes: Mallum in se and Mallum Prohibitum.  Mallum in se is something that is inherently wrong. The Latin means bad in itself.  Murder, robbery, rape... Things that are traditionally thought of as evil.  Mallum Prohibitum is something that is not inherently bad, but is prohibited for the better of society.  Littering - putting a piece of paper is not inherently evil, trash everywhere is a bad thing.  Going fast in a school zone, not necessarily bad, but it could lead to bad things so it is forbidden.  Other than that, laws are supposed to be a balance between what an individual wants and when those wants step on others' rights to pursue what they want.  Life, liberty and property (or for the rhetorical flourish, the pursuit of happiness) are to be protected.	1430441917	3	0	0	0

AskReddit	MrsMarshmellow	Sorry, but no. What I said was mostly in jest, with little actual seriousness thrown in. I am aware that at times I am not the most rational that I can be and because I am aware of this, I am able to take steps to minimize this occurrence. Even at times when I am not the most rational, I am still able to maintain rationality about serious issues.  Additionally, in my experience most people have times when they act with little to no rationality. The difference between me and them is that I act irrationally about food when hungry while other people may act irrational about going to sleep when tired. I know that at times my husband acts irrational about what to have for supper as well. Those things do not indicate if someone would be a good leader or not.  Finally, a sign of a good leader is not one without faults. A better leader would be one that is aware of, able to acknowledge and consciously works on getting past their faults. As long as anyone, male or female, has those traits than they are off to a great start to being able to run a country.	1430441998	1	0	0	0

AskReddit	djchozen91	"No, you don't get it. The peaceful protesting and the riots started at the exact same time. Freddie Gray dies, a percentage of people peacefully protest, a percentage violently protest. And despite what most of the media will tell you, the percentage difference is actually not that far apart.  And even still, people should be allowed to peacefully protest, WHENEVER THEY WANT. The authorities should have the common sense to be able to distinguish between those peacefully protesting and those not.   And the ""terrible time to do so"" comment is a joke of an argument. The BEST time to protest something is right after the event takes place. That's when protests are most effective... In fact you could argue, the more PEACEFUL protesters out on the streets at this time the BETTER, in order to counteract those who are violently protesting. There are MULTIPLE videos you can view RIGHT NOW online that show peaceful protesters attempting to reason with the violent ones and engaging in discussion with them. I've even seen them trying to PROTECT the national guard from violent advances... "	1430442012	1	0	0	0

A weak person will seem trustworthy and I may care about them and then they betray me because shit is getting hard and then they'll try to cover it up because they are too weak to be honest and honorable. Even if they do tell the truth and explain how they will never do it again, how can you trust them? They have already proven their weakness and lack of self-control 	1430442091	1	0	0	0

AskReddit	coleosis1414	I'm like that with kittens too.   I've had a fair share of cats in my life. But they're never mine. I always end up with roommates who can't afford or are I'll equipped to own a cat, but you know. Kitties are cute and they're 19 so they don't think about the fact that their scheduled and budgets don't allow for a kitten.  It's those times that I get frustrated. When I inevitably end up being the one who takes care of their needy kitten. My current roommate refuses to spay her cat. Even though we live in a town with an animal shelter flooded with unwanted cats. Even though there is a handful of places that would do it for free, she won't spay her. She just thinks it will be fun to breed her one day! Ugh.  Here's the thing about un-spayed cats that aren't getting laid: they want to. Really badly. And they're actively in heat for like nine out of every twenty days. The yowling and pawing at my door, the rubbing of her little cat vagina against my leg, the constant disturbing mating calls... It pisses me off, but it doesn't make me mad at the cat. Just my roommate for forcing the cat into my life.  I've had my own cat before. I understand the responsibilities that come with owning a cat, so the hijinks didn't get on my nerves so much. It's when I'm an ancillary victim of my roommate's terrible decision making that I get angry.	1430442105	106	0	0	0

The teacher in question is meant to be responsible for their children so anything that may be construed as a black mark on their parenting skills could be seen as a black mark on their abilities as a teacher by the parents of her students.

He was there every day, had arm sleeves of tattoos and did not seem like a typical teacher. One day he was subbing for a class and the girl was singing, to which he replied ""shut up fatty"" in front of the whole class. Realizing what he did, he took her outside and apologized.

AskReddit	rrrx	That's nice, but, again, *your favorite beer is Kronenbourg*. Which is fine, but there's just not a conversation here; I'm not going to argue that typical American pale lagers aren't terrible, because they are. But if you like Kronenbourg, then you probably *also* wouldn't like the vast wealth of phenomenal beers brewed in America, which have been acclaimed by beer drinkers and brewers around Europe for twenty years or so. American beer has actually been profoundly influential to the new wave of brewing you're seeing throughout Europe; breweries like The Kernel and Meantime in the UK, and Mikkeller and To Øl in Denmark, and Nøgne Ø and Ægir in Norway, and Faust zu Miltenberg and Maxbrauerei in Germany, and de Struise and Alvinne in Belgium (and so on and so on) have been directly inspired by American craft brewing.   It's just a bit like saying you don't like Australian wine because Yellowtail is garbage, while your preferred swill is Franzia.	1430442154	1	0	0	0

AskReddit	3d_extra	I have a creaky plastic piece of shit under my palms right now. It is big enough and heavy enough to be used as a blunt weapon in Skyrim. The first reviews for it were in 2008, which is when I bought it. Same price as a general macbook.  The screen on this thing is beautiful, it has 4 gigs of DDR 3 ram, a discrete Geforce 9800M GTS graphic card, a half-decent processor and in addition to the original 240 gb hard drive I added a 500 gb hard drive in the second hard drive slot. I've had this thing for seven years and it still gives modern laptops a run for their money. And an external mouse is better than a trackpad any day of the week.  As in anything, you make trade-offs and you choose what fits your needs. If I needed to bring this blunt weapon to classes then it would be a liability and a macbook would have been the much better choice, but as a mobile desktop replacement it is just fine. And I can't afford a new laptop that would perform similarly.	1430442173	1	0	0	0

AskReddit	my_cat_the_santanist	In my final year of highschool a got a message from my favourite primary school teacher who I hadnt seen or heard from since I was in primary school. I wanted to be a teacher because of him and still remember his lessons far more than anything I have ever learnt. He wished me the best in my life and congratulated me on about to finish highschool. He hoped my brother and me were still close and that my family have wonderful lives. I told my mum about it and she just gasped. This man has severe dementia and doesn't remember his own family most days, but somehow he remembered me and my family and wrote the most beautiful message, telling me to never stop skiing (my dream when i was in primary school) and that he won't ever forget how good i was in mathematics although i hated it. I couldn't believe someone would care about me enough to remember me like that and that his message made me so grateful. Mr Ross, thankyou. You have taught me so much, and this last lesson, this message of care is something I will have forever. 	1430442189	1	0	0	0

They yanked the tube out and I saw some blood come out, my chest was heavy and I was shaking uncontrollably everywhere. It was as if I was naked in the snow, but I wasn't cold.  Apparently what happened is I had an allergic reaction to the morphine, that ""sleepyness"" was my body starting to shut down a bit. As I slept my then gf noticed I was blue and wheezing. The shoved the tube down to force air in my lungs and gave me a large shot of some drug to flush the morphine out of my body.  That shaking feeling was literally my body quitting a drug cold turkey.

AskReddit	MeusVerum	I have experienced being called names or threatened a few times but that is FAR from the most insidious aspect of racism against white people.   IMO the one truly impactful aspect of racism for whites is the use of accusations to socially humiliate and silence them. I am actually less free to speak about my views and opinions than any non-white. I run the risk of losing what I work hard for in reputation and relationships and even career if I dare to express any view that is not congruent with the social narrative. Of course tens of millions of people probably  assume I just have the inherent privilege of something or other and probably don't think or care that I take responsibility for myself and climb hurdles and overcome doubts and work hard to earn what I have in life.  It's cool though, because you can't keep me down. ;)	1430442245	0	0	0	0

AskReddit	yellowwbird	My grandmother killed herself on my eleventh birthday in my parents house. I later found out that she was an alcoholic and had borderline personality disorder and put my mom and her brothers through hell growing up. Any time something didn't go her way, she would attempt to kill herself and end up in the hospital. As she got older and couldn't take care of herself, she moved in with my family. My mother warned her that if she was going to try anything stupid, that she better not make a huge scene. She got drunk and shit all over the bathroom walls and floor on the first night. She only lasted a few days after that. I was told she died in her sleep.   The real secret I found on my own was when I was looking for my birth certificate many years later, I stumbled upon a birthday card from her that my mom had kept. My mother later confessed to me that it was found under my grandmother's body.  	1430442251	31	0	0	0

AskReddit	LSDnSideBurns	"Not a teacher, but a student, this one always stuck with me.  In 9th grade, notorious asshole Mr. M was dispensing one of his many compelling life lessons or some other pseudo-philosophical bullshit. Earlier in the year he had shown us [this photo](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/b8/Kevin-Carter-Child-Vulture-Sudan.jpg), shot by a famous photographer who ended his life shortly after taking the photo.  Mr. M asks the class if they remembered the name of the photographer from earlier that year, and where the picture was taken and why, most students nodded their head, even though it was likely that most really didn't remember all the details, but at the very least we knew it was 'that suicide guy photo from Africa or whatever'.  One boy, however, shook his head no, and clearly within the context had simply forgotten the man's name. Without skipping a beat, Mr. M turns to him and says:   ""Perhaps you ought to consider a career in small-engine repair, then.""  He carried on his talk while the boy sat slumped in his chair, and we all stared at him in stunned silence.  I honestly regret not saying anything to Mr. M or the administration, and once I get my time machine working that will probably be my 2nd or 3rd stop, so I can punch that guy square in the dick."	1430442276	1	0	0	0

AskReddit	OmniscientOctopode	I'd say rape is when a person(s) who is capable of giving consent has sex with a person(s) who isn't. Obviously BAC and its effects on decision making varies based on the person, but I'd be comfortable saying that in the vast majority of cases where one person is drunk/buzzed and the other is sober (as the person I replied to mentioned) that a rape occurred.  If two people are drunk, then in most cases it's a wash. Obviously there are different levels of drunk, but I'd say once your ability to consent is impaired you can't really be said to be taking advantage of someone who is similarly impaired, assuming this is your average hook up and not someone being forced to have sex.	1430442291	1	0	0	0

AskReddit	Rather_Unfortunate	Oh ho! This is my kind of question. I'm rubbing my hands gleefully. In my head, though, because no one *actually* rubs their hands.  Let's look at three different transitions, exploring an example from each transition and looking at *why* each one is an intermediate form:  **Fish to amphibian intermediates**  You know what a fish is, of course. And you know what an amphibian is. So a fossil showing an intermediate between the two should have features of both, yes?  Well, as luck would have it, we have [Tiktaalik.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiktaalik)   * It has shoulders and limb like an amphibian. But they lead to fins, like a fish.   * It has gills like a fish. But it also has primitive lungs, enabling it to breath on land.   * It has a spiracle like a fish that seems to be some way towards eventually becoming an ear. What advantage this conferred at the time, I don't know.   * It has scales like a fish.   * It has ribs like an amphibian.  And that's not all! There are other intermediates at different stages between fish and amphibians. Panderichthys (very fishy), Eusthenopteron(even more fishy) Ichthyostega (mostly amphibian) and Acanthostega (also mostly amphibian).  **Dinosaurs to birds**  Now, this next one, I'm sure you've probably heard of yourself: [Archaeopteryx.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archaeopteryx)   * It has a straight, frond-like tail like a dinosaur, rather than a short, fan-like tail like modern birds.   * It has feathers like a bird.   * It has claws on its forelimbs like a dinosaur.   * It lacks a bony breastbone (all modern birds have one). This is in common with dinosaurs.  And again, that's not all! Apart from the 8 separate Archaeopteryx fossils known, there is Sinosauropteryx, Caudipteryx, Protoarchaeopteryx and many more. In fact, more recent evidence is suggesting that an awful lot of theropod dinosaurs actually had feathers, suggesting that the link might go back further than previously anticipated.  **Reptiles to Mammals**  Now, with this one, we're actually quite lucky, because there was actually a period just before the dinosaurs came to dominance when the land was dominated by mammal-like reptiles just like the ones we're looking for. Unfortunately, most of them went extinct in the biggest mass-extinction in Earth's history, and so most of those lineages didn't end up actually becoming mammals. But there are some that survived.  Let's look at one: the [Cynodont.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cynodont) If you've watched the BBC series *Walking With Dinosaurs,* you might recognise the name from the first episode.   * It has bones in the jaw that are a cross between a mammalian and reptilian ear system.   * The blood vessel distribution to the front of its snout suggests it may have had whiskers.   * It possesses different kinds of teeth, like a mammal. Reptiles tend to have the same kind of teeth throughout their mouths.   * Its shoulder and hips are akin to those of a reptile, in that they're out to the side.   * It probably laid eggs. How this is known, I don't know.   * The septomaxilla (a bone in the front of the face) is akin to earlier mammal-like reptiles.  **To round things off...**  The examples I have posted are just scratching the surface of the surface of the surface. There have been thousands of intermediate species discovered over the years, and the idea that there are none was already made redundant even during Darwin's lifetime. In fact, two of the examples I talked about (Archaeopteryx and Cynodont) were actually classified and described by one of Darwin's most powerful and fierce critics; Sir Richard Owen.   **TL; DR:** Yes. Lots.	1430442301	1	0	0	0

It's a mixed bag, some are very intelligent yet socially awkward, while some have a lot of trouble speaking or staying focused or other diagnoses.  A coworker of mine, whom I don't know why we still have him around in the first place, said about one student who is on the severe side of the spectrum ""he's annoying.""   This is a kid who would need various therapies or interventions to even be aware of his own behavior. He was isolated by his fellow classmates for the way he behaved, which again, he was barely aware of. This job takes infinite patience. It can be challenging some days, but you never insult a student."	1430442302	1	0	0	0

AskReddit	Meis_113	Depends what you consider learning and what you want to learn. If you mean academically, you can continue in your studies or take other courses to expand your qualifications. If you mean experience, you can start looking for work and/or volunteer somewhere to get some new perspectives within a job/organization and general work skills needed for later. If you mean mentally or emotionally, traveling is a great way to learn and expand your knowledge about the world and depending on the type of traveling, you can learn a great deal about yourself. Volunteering and traveling can hit two birds with one stone - but all of this is assuming you have the resources to do it. So, it really depends on what type of learning you want to do. 	1430442310	2	0	0	0

AskReddit	Irfo4	I had a physics teacher who was a different religion and this was happening right in a middle of civil unrest.   Most people were nice but this guy was a grade A ass.  One time while explaining some physics rule he called my name and said that it would be the same if my mom tells me are good looking but in reality you are not.  That same teacher called me out by saying that cups I drew were wrong.  One was 4 ounces another one 10 when they were suppose to be 6 and 12.  Lastly, I was a straight A student my whole life but he wanted to fail me until school officials talked to him and he gave me a passing grade.  Yeaaa...	1430442312	1	0	0	0

AskReddit	Alexsweatshirt_	I regularly have a dream where I return to my first job I had as a high schooler, even though I have since graduated college and work in nothing similar to that job.   When I was in school, every semester I'd have the same dream that the last week of school I realized that I had another class I signed up for but forgot to attend all year long.  Finally, I still about once a month have a reoccurring dream about the same girl. She is not someone that I have knowingly met in my real life. She always shows up though. I notice that I'm in a pretty good mood the days following a dream where she shows up. I look forward to those nights.	1430442313	1	0	0	0

I am not sure why I was so stupid to begin with. I was really good at drawing for my age so maybe I was just into that and dgaf'ed about learning to communicate with people.

The feeling is one of regret over some sort of MAJOR catastrophic disaster, like I pressed the ""Launch Nukes"" button or something.    And thats it... I wake up..

AskReddit	EntropyNZ	"I just gave you 5 sources (recent peer-reviewed articles from reputable sources no less) that all say that it has a direct negative effect on driving... I could link 40+ others, but I don't have the time.  If you're looking for something that's going to say ""We are 100% certain, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that marijuana has a significant, reproducible, negative effect on driving in all individuals"", then you're going to be waiting a really, really long time, because that's not how it works.   'Nobody's conclusively proven that it's bad' isn't a reason for you to assume that it's fine to be doing. The current available evidence trends pretty strongly toward it having a negative impact on driving. Now, I assume that you smoke (which given your views on this, I feel is a pretty safe assumption); there's no way you can honestly say that, while high, you're thinking as quickly, are as aware of situational changes in your environment, or have the same reaction times as you do when you're sober (properly sober, not 'my normal state is high now, so sober feels weird and I don't like it' sober). It's just not going to happen any more than you going into bronchospasm when put on a ventolin neb, it's just not how the drug affects your body.  I've got absolutely no issue with anyone smoking, and I see no reason for marijuana to be illegal, but you're really not helping other people get over the social stigma associated with the drug if you're trying to put it on a pedestal as a wonder-substance with no negative effects.

Her line, ""I wish you had never come back to school. The school is better off without you."" (I had been sick because of stress/anxiety caused by them and my home life).  This was also the same teacher who made all us girls change in the classroom with the boys at 11 years old. I used to sneak into the toilet because my clothes were too small for me (I had outgrown my clothes and since I only had a few months left there mum wasn't going to replace them) to get into without showing off everything, since I didn't have a bra. When she caught me, she made me change in front of everyone and as soon as I got my shirt off, she made the entire class look at me and tried to embarrass me.

As for landing, you don't really notice that you're descending until the last ~1 minute when it starts to feel like you're on a drop tower at a theme park but obviously not as extreme and in short bursts not one big fall.  Oh, and your ears pop several times which is probably the most annoying aspect of it.  That's honestly the most detailed explanation I can give you, even though it sound simple. To me this is exactly what it feels like.	1430442428	2	0	0	0

AskReddit	Liakada	The unquantifiable positive is something that you can't comprehend before you have it. You can't observe it as an outsider or define it or rationalize it. It can only be felt once the connection with the child is there. Even now that I feel it with my kids, I still don't see it or understand it in other people.  The only way I can think of describing how the positive outweighs the negative is when you compare it to the extreme deeply in love feeling you have for your significant other when you just fell in love - as the positive, and the very small annoying ticks he/she might have that you discover a few years later but are minor enough to live with - as the negative. Multiply both of those feelings times 10 and you have an extreme feeling of love that still outweighs the biggest tantrums.  Maybe the biggest difference that makes people childfree vs. having kids is that one doesn't want to risk a stress free life for an unknown potential of amazing feelings. The other people don't want to risk missing out on that potential for amazing feelings for the sake of a stress free life. I wonder if there are any personality studies on what character traits correlate with childfree life choices. Anyway, I'm a very rational and introvert person and would probably be a good candidate for not having kids, but I was too curious about how that parent child connection feels and thankfully it as worth it. 	1430442453	3	0	0	0

AskReddit	BlindfoldedNinja	"I really have to call you out on that kind of fuzzy thinking. A crack-dealers illegally purchased AK-47's mission is to preserve lives (the dealers), it's still going to get pointed at someone.   When SWAT members execute a search, their guns are out and pointed, because they are a military style operation responding to what's believed to be an armed and dangerous threat. Saying ""SWATS mission is to preserve lives"" is so unbelievably fluffy I just got diabetes. Would you let your kids run around the house with an air rifle during a SWAT raid? No, because they could be shot by armed men pointing guns who are there to 'preserve lives' in a kinda sorta way."	1430442487	3	0	0	0

AskReddit	Unloveable_Me	Help me? I dont recall asking for help so I think you must have me confused.  Your comments are also confusing. On the one hand you claim that you had no control, could see nothing. Then, on the other, you say that you could see the signs but your addiction to your partner prevented you from leaving.  Obsession and addiction are not signs of a healthy relationship. Sorry. Further, I do not agree (at all) that love clouds rationality. Again, if you chose to ignore the behavior and words of another person, that is not the other person's fault. It is yours. Setting aside your responsibility because of emotion or addiction are simply excuses so that you can justify why you stayed.	1430442499	1	0	0	0

AskReddit	Atlanta_7	If we miss trash day, there will be another one in 7 days.  Sports?  It's a one time thing with those specific athletes, venue, rules, maybe people they watched it with, who they were dating.  Did we have shots or not?    Is that when we met someone like you or maybe we were with a buddy who's girlfriend knew as much about the game as we did etc. etc.    Wanna be permanent part of guy's memory?  Go to a ball game with him.  Heck, go to the closest and worst baseball game around if he remotely like baseball.    We'll get to an inner peace on the way there.   Sit in the worst seats at the worst game and he'll remember the nachos you ate and little bit of cheese on your face.  The weather.  The score?  That's baby stuff, it's just a fact associated with whatever happened from the time you started towards the stadium until you got home.   If you beat him at darts, or got him to try a new beer or shot or whatever, it's all on lock down forever. 	1430442558	1	0	0	0

AskReddit	Asterai_	An alternative that may also work.  When my sister comes to me with a problem, I will sometimes directly ask her whether she wants solutions or sympathy.  She answers, I help her how she actually wants, we all go home happy.  I think part of the reason women often look for sympathy over solutions is that they recognize, either implicitly or explicitly, that the problem in question is not solvable.  You're sad because the world sucks?  Well, shit, that can't be solved, but it can be commiserated with.  How to do better at your work can be solved; getting a perma-grump boss off your case might not be solvable.  Quitting or transferring might not be viable options, and some people truly can't be happy with anything.  Being in a situation where pleasing one person automatically dispeases another might not be solvable.  Two of your friends disliking each other might not be solvable.  Not having enough money can be solved by spending less, but only if you have non-essential purchases in the budget, or by making more, but only if your responsibilities don't preclude extra hours.	1430442569	4	0	0	0

AskReddit	B0NERSTORM	Funny thing is that stuff like Gatorade are really mostly placebo drinks.  Are electrolytes helpful?  Yeah they are.  But unless you're doing a marathon or something, you'll most likely never lose enough salt to need what's in Gatorade.  I hear it takes something like an hour of continuous intense activity before you get anywhere close.  In fact the sugar in gatorade can lead to cramps.  Supposedly high level athletes dilute their gatorade or drink colored water because they still need to support their sponsor but don't want the sugar and/or salts.  The thing is though that studies show that drinking flavored colored water, regardless of content, will actually improve performance over just plain water.  So workout beverages appear to be placebo drinks for the vast majority of people who drink it.	1430442591	2	0	0	0

Of course in such a system you might just want to redefine it.  But many of the basic limits we're used to don't work once you allow infinitesimals.  (This is all assuming order topology, of course.

But here is Where it gets weird, I had those dreams when I was about 4 to 6 years old, nightly, but it eventually stopped. But then when I was ten years old or so, I would have the Same dream, but a continuation Where I would run into a porto potty and all of a sudden, in the porto potty, my foot gets held down by some invisible force, and just as I seem to kick free, I wake up.	1430442626	1	0	0	0

AskReddit	darksoldierk	"And rape should be taken very very seriously. I don't think anyone anywhere in their right mind could say that rape isn't one of the worst things that could happen to a person.   However, because of how severely a mere accusation can change the life of the person accused, these accusations should be treated differently. For example, it should be illegal for the media to report the incident until it is proven that the person accused actually committed the crime. Another example could be penalizing for for false accusations. For example, if it is proven in a court of law that a rape did not occur, and that there is evidence that the accusations was purposefully false, than there should be another law suit. If it is proven that the accusation was false, then, at the very least, there should be a hefty fine plus legal costs of both the accuser and the accused charged to the accuser. Obviously, the law would have to be careful to not discourage people from reporting events that they genuinly believe is rape.  The current state is just ridiculous. Any woman could accuse a man of rape. The man would lose his job, his friends, his family, and after months of being in court he is lucky to even get a ""I'm sorry"". "	1430442640	3	0	0	0

AskReddit	RealityIsMyReligion	The other aspect is that men tend to look the same every day, while women often change their appearance with different hairstyles and makeup.  Most guys are used to being complimented when they get a haircut, which makes sense since that's the must major change of appearance that men display.  I have started experimenting with different hairstyles and light use of makeup, and I have noticed an almost immediate increase in the compliments that I receive from both women and men.  Men never notice the makeup, just that you look more refined.  When women notice you wear makeup, they want to talk to you about it and compliment you more on your appearance.  Tl;Dr:  Men should wear makeup and toy with their hair.  It won't make you look girly.	1430442658	-4	0	0	0

I understand being against it if you have a good reason, like in the bible it does says something along the lines of marriage being so a man and a woman can populate the earth. If you say that you don't support it because the holy book says not to, but you don't read into why the book says it's bad to marry someone of the same sex, then I think that's wrong. But I do support it because marriage is also meant for you to be with someone you love more than anything else, someone you want to get old and die with. Someone you want to spend the rest of your life with. And If you and someone else think that you love each other enough, whether they be the same sex or not, then I think you are inclined to be married. I just hate people that follow the gospel blindly. I left the church partially because of it. 	1430442671	1	0	0	0

AskReddit	Stevenasaurus	My best friend since kindergarten Cheryl was killed by a drunk driver along with her father. Since the 7th grade, I wrote her a poem every month and mailed it to her (They weren't Maya Angelou quality, but it's the thought that counts right?). I pretty much thought she would just throw them around after reading them a few times but I discovered she had a shoebox under her bed with all 37 poems from 7th grade when I started writing them to 9th grade when she was killed.	1430442682	567	0	0	0

It can wreck their GPA, which makes them less hire-able (sometimes) or, worse, it can make them take longer to graduate. So oftentimes it's difficult to fail. 2. Professors like rewarding effort. So if someone works REALLY hard, does a TON of extra credit work, sees you in your office hours, etc etc, the professor is more likely to pass them. 	1430442696	7	0	0	0

My students were sitting right next to me.

AskReddit	BizzQuit	I try to get my daughters mother to come back to us every few years....usually works great until shes around them...then she freaks and takes off again. They are graduating in a few weeks. Ive raised them on my own since they were about 18 months old when she started having issues between her fragile mental health and our daughters need for my attention.    Ive been trying, for the better part of the last year to get her to put the issues of our past behind, leave her current husband, and return to me.  OR tell me its over, theres nothing left between us, and let me go.   I could easily find someone who hasnt spent the past 2 decades flipping my life upside down.   I could easily find someone who has far less mental health drama to address.   I certainly could find someone more attractive...age has not worn well on my love.    But that right there is it...love....despite any logical understanding...I love her. I probably always will. She will most likely NOT leave her husband...  She doesnt love him...   kept my last name...   told him I am her one true love and that if he cant respect that she wouldnt marry him...    and actually thought that those steps would be enough respect to me, that I would not be bothered.....she is still upset 5 years later that i wont sleep with her until she is divorced. Yep Im the ass LOL    I doubt we will work out...I doubt she will leave him and her life there. She isnt happy but she is stable....and she has so much guilt and fears about us...that I dont know if any of this would change a thing....but whats another year of torment.  	1430442699	1	0	0	0

AskReddit	Hypothesis_Null	"In general, I'd be interested if you have more examples.  There's no way to show whether or not this disproves the trend I'm stating, or just goes against it.  I will also point out that ""solidly"" here means 60% republicans for local government, and still barley cutting for Obama at the Federal Level.  To me that says ~30% conservative at most, with some Republicans, about an equal number of Democrats/Liberals, and a big chunk of independents.  And there isn't much indication how much each group is contributing to that 30%.  Additionally, that 30% number also may be inflated - it seems to include kids that have opted out of *some* vaccine - not most or all of them.  There's a distinction between anti-vaxxers who refuse all vaccines, and those that, say, hold off on a Chickenpox booster because of random age requirements or insurance reasons.  You'll have to come back with a stronger case than: *""One of the worst non-vaccinating counties is in one of the slightly conservative counties of California, therefore conservatives hate vaccines.""*  I'm not saying your wrong.  I'm saying that this alone isn't much better than nothing if you're trying to prove you're right."	1430442762	3	0	0	0

I know if it sees me, something very very bad will happen...  And that's it. it's not much, but believe me it's the most terrifying thing I have experienced.

Obviously it's not an ideal energy source, because it takes a while before your body starts burning it. But it is precisely because of this that fat is valuable evolutionarily. It's a source of energy that the body can hold on to until it absolutely needs it, like when there is no food available. The body stores fat so that in the event of starvation it will have an energy source to live off of.	1430442828	0	0	0	0

AskReddit	bracketdash	First off, spacetime is not infinite. We have known since somewhere around 2006 that spacetime is finite, and is best thought of as a 4-dimensional bubble.  Second, yes, it can feel like everything is uncertain sometimes, but I find it helps a lot to step back and realize that we don't *have* to know everything for sure in order to make sense of everything. [Occam's Razor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor) is excellent for this purpose.  We may be living inside a computer simulation for all we know, and nobody we think we know is an actual, real person. But, using Occam's Razor, we can say that for all practical purposes, we are real and we are living in a real world, having real interactions, because, regardless of whether that's the case or not, we can go about our lives as if it wasn't the case and nothing will change for us.	1430442830	1	0	0	0

AskReddit	[deleted]	Chromosome-wise you will always be your gender.   Biologically speaking? If your hormone levels are that of a woman and you have your sexual organs altered to be a woman, there is no difference beyond the visual differences like bone structure and organ layout.  Some women are born women but have no uterus of ovaries because of medical issues.   Are they not women anymore because they take hormone medication and lack certain organs?  I was born male. I have naturally low testosterone because of a thyroid condition. I had to be given shots to regulate it.   Does the fact my hormones are naturally less make me less of a male? I get boners, I make semen, I can have kids, etc.  Some men are hormonally normal but have no reproductive ability. They are either sterile or they have no testicles. Are they not men?  What about the men who had vasectomies? Are they also not men?  The second you start this discussion you have to walk through a whole list of scenarios before you come to a conclusion.   Male and Female are real. They are ways in which our bodies change as a result of hormone exposure. The question is, does how someone feels grant them rights if they haven't transitioned?  I would argue that biological preference is not the same as people who have taken the step to transition. 	1430442836	2	0	0	0

AskReddit	AstralEmissary	"I'm in a metropolitan city, at the highest floor of some building, always with a girl I know. She changes every time I have the dream, as does the situation. Recently, it was a foreign exchange student from my school. She was late for her flight home, and a couple of friends were with me for some reason. After we all arrived at the airport, we realized that her flight had left. She (the exchange student) is visibly upset, and I do something that is very unlike me, and that is comforting her. The next events are a blur, but they result in the arrival at the aforementioned building. After a long and heartfelt conversation, we stand up (my friends have somehow disappeared) and look out the huge window overlooking the beautiful sunset city. The skyscrapers are dazzling, reflecting light like towers made of diamonds. We lock eyes, and I feel this sensation that I've never felt before. Something possibly noteworthy is that my vision ""pans out"" to a third person view of both of us, like I'm watching myself. She leans in, and so do I. We share a kiss that I can only describe as unreal. As we stop, I take one last look out of the window at this beautiful place and think, ""This is what love must feel like."" I can't explain it or figure out why I'm dreaming about this."	1430442838	1	0	0	0

I'm sure if I was a little more assertive, it wouldn't be so bad, but I'm not very assertive and so I just always stand around feeling awkward until someone talks specifically to me.

Of course it's not nearly as cut and dry as the quick assertion I provided.   Lynn Margolies, Ph.D. also had a little bit to say on the matter. She attributes certain behaviors between women to societal disapproval of overt competition.   There are probably hundreds of studies using different methodologies evaluating similar hypotheses. Lemme know what you think. Personally I haven't really discussed such things since I was in school, when I learned about organizational psychology differences between men and women, but I'm not aware of any major shift in prevailing thought on the matter.	1430442905	1	0	0	0

AskReddit	Mr_Fifths	"Okay fair enough. You've been a nice guy. I just feel on the defensive after the backlash. I have no friends who are religious. I have friends from many different European countries thanks to my time studying at Universities. None of them either have been religious.   Now when I say we laugh at American religiosity, I was not joking. I have never gone out of my way to laugh at a religious person in person. That's disrespectful obviously. In discussions about America or religion do people bring up their religion? Yes. Do we laugh at the absurdity of it? Yes. It has been this was since I was very young and continues today even though I'm in my late 20s. The idea of someone being religious to the extent that they believe the bible is absurd to me and yes I do find that funny. I'm quite sure in many of the secular European countries you would find people agreeing with me.   You say you've never encountered this? Probably because like I said, I wouldn't laugh at you in person for having a different belief. However if you came up to me and said,  "" I genuinely believe the Noah story""   Then I'm quite sure I would laugh. Not in an offensive way but it's just so absurd to me.  Also perhaps you are Religious in a more spiritual way. Perhaps you don't take the bible literally and just follow the general morality principle of the texts. If this is the case generally it would be hard to tell you were religious. Unsurprisingly people who are religious in this regard are far less dogmatic and therefor it does not come up as much.   In all honesty I would still find your faith unusual as I still have no friends or friends of friends who are religious. Nor family neither. And without being a nasty person, I would wonder how someone educated could see all the evidence and still come to the conclusion of a divine creator. So perhaps even deep down I might still chuckle.   That's my two cents.    "	1430442954	2	0	0	0

AskReddit	Lastonk	we were spinning in circles with a 1969 Dodge Charger we had modified, leaving a lot of smoke on the road from the tires, when a 1976 Ford Pinto driven by  someone who didn't look like he knew much challenged us to a quarter mile drag race. We were unimpressed by the car, it didn't look like it had anything special, so we decided to race. It had been secretly modified extensively, and we lost.

AskReddit	kingfrito_5005	I have personally got in (polite) arguments with my department chair multiple times over the laxity in the low level classes. He insists that its fair, if they really want to be coders they will improve in the 300 and 400 level courses. It was still frustrating for me to see. I too however feel very good about my job prospects, though I will have a 4 year degree, I also have a number of independant projects and skills and experience that I picked up outside of school for fun.

Part of the requirement to receive an HfH house is to actually work on the house yourself during the construction process. The woman in question showed up in the morning and basically did nothing, just kind of standing around watching other people build a free house for her.   I wouldn't say I came away disillusioned, since I had a pretty fun time with my friends that day learning a little bit about roofing. But it showed me how unappreciative someone can be of the help they are receiving from others. 	1430442979	1	0	0	0

AskReddit	converseroses	"It's not a recurring Dream but a Place.  I'm a very vivid dreamer and I can remember usually about 80% of my dreams.  Anyway I kept dreaming of this school, one that I've never seen before in real life. There was something very off about this school, everything seemed normal but it wasn't, I can't put into words how strange I felt being in this school. The classrooms were brightly colored but the hallways were dim. In the entrance of the school is this patch of grass and one tree, a tree where the principal would always stand, and stare at me. The first dream with the school was like my first day, I had gone to all the classes according to my schedule, the teachers seemed to always have really strange, forced smiles and would always find an excuse to get me in trouble. Later in the dream when school ended I waited in the patch of grass in front of the school with the principal waiting to be picked up by my mom. After many kids had left already I began to panic for being alone with the creepy pedo principal. Finally I'm alone with him and he tried to talk to me, ""What's wrong?"" He would say in a tone similar to a clown's. He would say things like that such as, ""Why are you so nervous? Calm down."" But in a creepy way with a forced smile like all the other people in the school. At this point I began to cry and was on the verge of screaming for my mom, and frantically calling her cell screaming at the voicemail for her to hurry and get me. At last she arrives and takes me home.  Ever since the creepy first dream, every time I dream of that school I seem to make it my mission to find out what dark secrets they're keeping, so far I still haven't found anything.  Also I keep dreaming of this park with lions in it."	1430442988	1	0	0	0

AskReddit	upvotesyoufromzero	I was at Ozzfest one year. Devil Driver was doing their thing. Crowd was moshing. One of those meat neck dudes ( you know the type, tribal tattoos and shredded) was clearly there to hurt someone. So meat neck is the the circle and gets pushed to the outside, so proper mosh pit etiquette is to push them back in unless they are actively trying to get out. So this kid gives dude a little shove to push meat neck back in and meat neck turns around and levels this kid. The pit stopped and about 6 fists come out of nowhere and just proceed to beat the brakes off of meat neck. Security saw the entire thing and took their sweet time getting meat neck out of there. It was pretty brutal, yet also pretty satisfying.	1430442994	2	0	0	0

It's harder for kids to learn how to read well if they have speech problems, because so much of learned to read is about sounding things out. So if you can't pronounce the sounds then you're up against a brick wall and have to rely on sight words rather than phonetics. And if you are struggling to read out loud, then it makes it really hard to stay positive, a lot of it is just being emotionally in the right place for kids. 	1430442997	2	0	0	0

But everything in there leads to where we are today, both good (stuff to strive for) and bad (lessons learned and to not be repeated).	1430443009	2	0	0	0

AskReddit	Buddhamama42	"I have three degrees. I left Uni at 28, well educated, but very poor :) I always wanted to be an apprentice potter, or a hairdresser, but was told I was ""too bright"".  Funny thing is, one of the girls I went to school with who was in the lowest streams for everything, left school at 16 and did a hairdressing apprenticeship. She travelled all over the world, and by 28 was running three salons. Turned out she wasn't stupid, she just wasn't much good at school.  And me ? At 42 I'm - yup you guessed it - learning to be a potter.  I wish I'd had the courage of my convictions when I was 15 to do what I knew I really wanted to do; instead of being pushed into University because I was ""bright"".  So it does cut both ways - just because you're good at school, doesn't necessarily mean you should go to University either. And just because you're not good at school, doesn't mean you're not very, very good at something else."	1430443036	18	0	0	0

Like butterflies in my stomach kind of nervous. And the closer I get to her the happier I feel. When I first had these dreams all that would happen was that she would caress my hair like she used to when she was alive, smile, and look out onto the horizon. It was so bittersweet because I couldn't speak to her. I mean, I knew it was a dream but I still couldn't bring myself to speak. I got awestruck every time. Recently, though, I got to touch her hair. And when I did, she smiled at me and told me ""you know I'll always love you."" And then she held me--guess I went back to being a child in the dream. I felt so peaceful.

AskReddit	sons_of_mothers	Okay I'll be completely honest here, I never saw the Lion King. People hype it up like it is the best Disney movie. I saw Frozen before the Lion King, yeah Frozen was pretty good. Then I saw the Lion King last month, it's not that great. It's rushed, some of the most famous songs aren't as fleshed out as I thought they'd be, and most characters were annoying.  What I'm getting at is Frozen is just as good as The Lion King, it's just hipsters and nostalgia controlling the popularity and reputation. 	1430443142	1	0	0	0
